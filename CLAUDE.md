# Psoriasis Book — Project Instructions

## Project Overview
- Quarto book, PDF output (6"x9", LuaLaTeX), British English
- 31 chapters (01-31) + 5 appendices (A1-A5) + abstract + preface
- Config: `_quarto.yml`
- Content: `src/content/docs/*.md`
- Build: `quarto render` → `_book/Psoriasis.pdf`
- Free online at [psoriasis.fyi](https://psoriasis.fyi), also on Amazon

## Author
Miko Pawlikowski. Engineer, not a doctor. Also wrote *Chaos Engineering* (Manning, 2021).

## Conventions
- Citations: inline `[(Author, Year)](URL)` with numbered ref list in A5-references.md
- Evidence labels: `**Research stage: [Established/Emerging/Experimental].** **Evidence strength: [High/…/Very Low].**`
- Section headings: `## X.Y` where X = chapter number
- YAML front matter: title, description, sidebar.order
- Glossary: alphabetical table in A4-glossary.md
- **Sync rule**: `_quarto.yml` and `src/content/docs/index.mdx` must stay in sync. When changing parts, title, subtitle, or chapter structure in `_quarto.yml`, also update `index.mdx` to match (cards, tagline, about section).

## Book Structure
Parts: Foundation & Context (01-03), Understanding the Disease (04-09), Clinical Recognition & Diagnosis (10-13), Psoriasis as a Systemic Disease (14-18), Living with Psoriasis (19-21), Treatment (22-26), Recent Advances & Future Directions (27-30), Conclusion (31), Appendices (A1-A5)

## Voice Summary

Miko writes like a knowledgeable colleague explaining something over coffee. Informal-authoritative. Direct, honest, confident without being arrogant. British English. Engineer's pragmatism: values clarity over elegance.

## DO — Miko's Natural Patterns

### 1. Vary sentence length dramatically
Long explanatory sentence, then short punchy one for emphasis.
- "Hundreds of different skills (hard and soft), a constantly shifting technological landscape, evolving requirements, personnel turnaround and a sheer scale of some organizations are all factors in how hard it can be to ensure no single points of failure. **She is a single point of failure.**"
- "I went looking for information. I wanted to understand *why*. [...] **So I wrote one.**"

### 2. Use contractions naturally
"it's", "don't", "they're", "won't", "didn't", "can't", "doesn't", "aren't", "you'll"
- "One problem with real life is that it's messy."
- "you don't need to remember the syntax of tc to implement it!"

### 3. Address the reader directly
Second person ("you", "your") and inclusive first person ("we", "let's").
- "Can you see where I'm going with this?"
- "You know your team, so do what you think works best."
- "Let's start with identifying single points of failure."

### 4. Ask rhetorical questions
Guide the reader's thinking by posing questions.
- "How do you think we could test them out?"
- "Would you do an inside job in production?"
- "Do you see any weak links?"

### 5. Prefer active voice
Name the agent. Say who did what.
- "Gruber discovered this in 1996" not "This was discovered by Gruber in 1996"
- "Studies show X" not "X has been shown"

### 6. Use "Now," and "After all," as transitions
- "Now, the team is made of individuals..."
- "After all, testing in production is an internet meme."
- "After all, to err is human."

### 7. Use dry, understated humour
Quick asides, not extended jokes. Self-deprecating. Move on immediately.
- "If only there was a methodology to uncover systemic problems in a distributed system... Oh wait!"
- "(spoiler: it's bad!)"

### 8. Define terms inline with parentheses on first use only
This is a genuine Miko pattern, but he does it once, not repeatedly.
- "(i.e. emergent properties of the system)"
- "(hard and soft)"

### 9. Lead with concrete examples, then extract principles
Describe the specific situation first, then define the concept. Never abstract-first.

### 10. Hedge honestly but briefly
Acknowledge uncertainty without throat-clearing.
- "it might be better to leave well alone"
- "The answer depends on many factors"
- NOT: "It is worth noting that" or "It should be emphasised that"

### 11. Use British English
"endeavour", "practise" (noun), "programme", "organisation", "colour", "recognised", "behaviour"

## DON'T — AI Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Em dash overuse
AI writes 15-40 em dashes (—) per chapter. Miko uses them sparingly. Replace most with commas, full stops, or parentheses. Keep only where they add genuine punch.

### 2. Formulaic sentence starters
NEVER start a sentence with: "Intriguingly,", "Reassuringly,", "Notably,", "Crucially,", "Importantly,", "Remarkably,", "Interestingly,"
These are the strongest AI tells. Let the content be interesting on its own.

### 3. Passive voice dominance
AI defaults to passive. Flip to active.
- BAD: "Psoriasis has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk"
- GOOD: "Psoriasis increases cardiovascular risk"
- BAD: "It is now recognised as a systemic disease"
- GOOD: "We now recognise it as a systemic disease"

### 4. Excessive parenthetical definitions
AI defines every term inline, every time. Define once on first use per chapter, then trust the reader. Don't re-define "cytokine", "biologic", or "keratinocyte" in every chapter.

### 5. Hedging throat-clearing
Delete entirely: "it is worth noting that", "it should be noted", "it is important to emphasise", "it is necessary to understand", "as previously mentioned"
Just say the thing.

### 6. Superlative stacking
AI piles on emphatic adjectives: "highly effective", "remarkably", "extraordinarily", "dramatic", "revolutionary", "transformative"
Let data speak for itself. "PASI 90 in 70% of patients" beats "remarkably effective therapy."

### 7. "Beyond X, Y" and "Whilst effective, Z"
These are formulaic AI transition patterns. Use natural transitions or just start the new idea.

### 8. Identical structural templates
AI makes every section follow the same pattern. Vary the structure: some sections can open with a question, some with a statistic, some with a historical anecdote, some with a direct statement.

## Before/After Examples

### Em dashes → simpler punctuation
- BEFORE: "The chronic systemic inflammation of psoriasis — driven by the same TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis — promotes endothelial dysfunction"
- AFTER: "The chronic systemic inflammation of psoriasis, driven by the same TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis, promotes endothelial dysfunction"

### Passive → active
- BEFORE: "Psoriasis patients have been shown to have up to 15% lower HDL cholesterol"
- AFTER: "Psoriasis patients have up to 15% lower HDL cholesterol"

### Formulaic starter → direct statement
- BEFORE: "Intriguingly, treatment with TNF-α inhibitors has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of myocardial infarction"
- AFTER: "TNF-α inhibitors actually decrease the risk of heart attacks in psoriasis patients"

### Hedging → just say it
- BEFORE: "It is worth noting that methotrexate was the exception. It consistently impaired humoral (antibody) responses"
- AFTER: "Methotrexate was the exception. It consistently impaired antibody responses"

### Flat → punchy (sentence length variation)
- BEFORE: "The discovery that the disease is primarily driven by a specific arm of the immune system has led directly to the development of highly effective biologic therapies that can achieve complete or near-complete skin clearance in the majority of patients."
- AFTER: "Once researchers identified the specific immune pathway driving the disease, everything changed. New biologic drugs could now target it directly. Most patients achieve complete or near-complete skin clearance."

### Over-defined → trust the reader
- BEFORE: "Psoriasis is significantly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (unhealthy levels of fats in the blood) — a cluster of conditions known as **metabolic syndrome**."
- AFTER: "Psoriasis is significantly associated with metabolic syndrome: obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia."

### Missing reader address → add it
- BEFORE: "Current guidelines do not recommend stopping biologic therapy during respiratory infections unless the treating physician advises otherwise."
- AFTER: "If you're on a biologic, you don't need to stop it during a respiratory infection unless your doctor specifically tells you to."
