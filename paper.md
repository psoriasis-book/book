## Abstract

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated (caused by the body's own immune system) inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 125 million people worldwide. Once considered a simple disorder of skin cell overgrowth, it is now understood as a complex systemic disease (one that affects the whole body, not just the skin) driven by dysregulated (improperly controlled) immune responses, genetic susceptibility, and environmental triggers. This paper synthesises the current state of scientific knowledge on psoriasis, drawing on peer-reviewed literature spanning immunology, genetics, epidemiology (the study of disease patterns in populations), and therapeutics. We present the molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis (how the disease develops and progresses) — including the central IL-23/IL-17 axis (a chain of immune signalling molecules that drives the disease; explained fully in Section 2) — in terms accessible to readers without prior immunology training. We also review the genetic architecture of psoriasis susceptibility, environmental risk factors, associated comorbidities, and the revolution in targeted biologic therapies that has transformed patient outcomes over the past two decades.

## 1. Introduction

Psoriasis is one of the most common and most studied inflammatory skin diseases in medicine, yet its pathogenesis (the biological process by which the disease develops) is still not completely understood. The disease follows a chronic, relapsing-remitting course — meaning symptoms come and go in cycles — and manifests most commonly as raised, red, scaly patches (called **plaques**) on the skin. These plaques are caused by an abnormally accelerated cycle of skin cell growth: where a normal skin cell matures and sheds over the course of roughly 28–30 days, psoriatic skin cells complete this cycle in just 3–5 days, resulting in a visible build-up of thick, silvery scales on the skin's surface.

However, the visible skin manifestation is only one dimension of the disease. Over the past three decades, research has firmly established psoriasis as a systemic inflammatory condition — one that affects not just the skin, but the joints, cardiovascular system, metabolism, and mental health. Patients with severe psoriasis have been shown to have a life expectancy approximately 3–5 years shorter than the general population, with cardiovascular disease contributing significantly to this discrepancy [(Ni & Chiu, 2014)](https://www.dovepress.com/psoriasis-and-comorbidities-links-and-risks-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID).

The modern understanding of psoriasis represents a triumph of translational immunology (turning laboratory discoveries about the immune system into real treatments). The discovery that the disease is primarily driven by a specific arm of the immune system — the **IL-23/Th17 axis** — has led directly to the development of highly effective biologic therapies (drugs made from living cells that target specific parts of the immune system, as opposed to traditional chemical drugs) that can achieve complete or near-complete skin clearance in the majority of patients [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

## 2. A Primer on the Immune System

To understand psoriasis at a molecular level, it is necessary to understand some fundamental concepts of immunology. This section defines the key vocabulary used throughout this paper.

### 2.1 Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity

The immune system is broadly divided into two branches:

- **Innate immunity** is the body's first line of defence. It responds rapidly and non-specifically to threats. Innate immune cells include **neutrophils** (the most abundant white blood cells, which engulf and destroy pathogens), **macrophages** (cells that engulf debris and pathogens and also present fragments of them to other immune cells), and **dendritic cells** (sentinel cells that detect threats and relay information to the adaptive immune system). Innate immunity also includes physical barriers like the skin itself.

- **Adaptive immunity** is a slower but highly specific response. It is carried out primarily by **T cells** and **B cells** — white blood cells that can recognise very specific molecular targets (called **antigens** — any substance that the immune system can recognise and respond to, such as a piece of a virus or bacterium). Adaptive immunity has memory: once it has encountered a pathogen (a disease-causing organism), it can mount a faster, stronger response upon re-exposure. This is the principle behind vaccination.

### 2.2 Key Cell Types

- **T cells** (or T lymphocytes): A major class of adaptive immune cells that mature in the thymus gland. There are many subtypes, including:
  - **T helper (Th) cells** (also called CD4+ T cells): These do not directly kill threats but instead coordinate the immune response by releasing signalling molecules called cytokines (explained in Section 2.3 below). Different subsets of Th cells produce different cytokine profiles — you can think of them as different specialist teams, each sending different instructions:
    - **Th1 cells** produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), promoting inflammation and activating macrophages.
    - **Th17 cells** produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22, and TNF-α. They are critical in psoriasis pathogenesis.
    - **Th22 cells** produce IL-22, which drives skin cell proliferation.
    - **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)** suppress excessive immune responses and maintain immune tolerance — the ability of the immune system to avoid attacking the body's own tissues. When Tregs don't function properly, the immune system can turn against the body (as happens in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like psoriasis).
  - **Cytotoxic T cells** (CD8+ T cells): These directly kill infected or abnormal cells.
- **Dendritic cells (DCs)**: Antigen-presenting cells that act as messengers between innate and adaptive immunity — they detect threats and show fragments of them to T cells, essentially saying "this is what we need to fight." Two key subtypes are:
  - **Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)**: Specialise in producing type I interferons (such as IFN-α), which are potent antiviral alarm signals. In psoriasis, pDCs are the cells that first sound the immune alarm.
  - **Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs)**: The primary producers of IL-12 and IL-23 in the skin. These are the cells that instruct T cells to specialise into different subtypes — a process called differentiation (when a general-purpose cell becomes a specialist).
- **Keratinocytes**: The predominant cell type in the epidermis (outer layer of skin). Although not classically considered immune cells, keratinocytes play an active immunological role: they produce antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and chemokines, and are key effector cells in psoriasis.
- **Neutrophils**: Innate immune cells that are among the first responders to sites of infection or injury. In psoriasis, they accumulate in characteristic micro-abscesses within the epidermis.

### 2.3 Key Signalling Molecules

- **Cytokines**: Small proteins released by cells that act as chemical messengers to regulate immune responses — think of them as text messages that cells send to each other, telling nearby cells to ramp up inflammation, calm down, multiply, or come to a specific location. The word "interleukin" (abbreviated IL) simply means "between white blood cells" and is the name given to a large family of cytokines. When you see "IL-" followed by a number (e.g. IL-17, IL-23), it's just the name of a specific cytokine in this family. Key psoriasis-related cytokines include:
  - **TNF-α (Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha)**: A major pro-inflammatory cytokine (a signalling protein that promotes inflammation) involved in many inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. It amplifies the immune response and was the first cytokine successfully targeted by psoriasis drugs.
  - **IL-17 (Interleukin-17)**: A cytokine family produced primarily by Th17 cells. IL-17A is the most important member in psoriasis. It acts as an instruction signal telling keratinocytes (skin cells) to multiply rapidly and produce their own inflammatory mediators — making it the key "effector" molecule that directly causes psoriatic skin changes.
  - **IL-23 (Interleukin-23)**: A cytokine produced by dendritic cells and macrophages. It is essential for creating and sustaining Th17 cells — without IL-23, Th17 cells cannot survive and multiply. This makes IL-23 the "upstream master switch" of the psoriasis inflammatory cascade. IL-23 is composed of two protein subunits (building blocks): p19 (unique to IL-23) and p40 (shared with another cytokine, IL-12). This structural detail matters because some drugs block only IL-23, while an older drug (ustekinumab) blocks both IL-23 and IL-12 by targeting the shared p40 piece.
  - **IL-22 (Interleukin-22)**: Drives keratinocyte proliferation (rapid cell division) and inhibits their normal differentiation (the process by which cells mature and specialise), contributing to the thickened epidermis seen in psoriatic plaques.
  - **IFN-γ (Interferon gamma)**: Produced by Th1 cells and natural killer cells. Activates macrophages and enhances antigen presentation.
  - **IFN-α (Interferon alpha)**: Produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Important in the initiation phase of psoriasis.
- **Chemokines**: A subset of cytokines whose specific job is to attract immune cells to particular locations — essentially "come here" signals (the name comes from "chemo-" meaning chemical + "-kine" meaning movement). For example, **CCL20** is a chemokine that attracts Th17 cells to the skin, which is why it plays such a critical role in the psoriasis feedback loop.
- **Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)**: Small protein fragments produced by keratinocytes that serve a dual role: they kill bacteria and other microbes on the skin's surface, but they also act as alarm signals to the immune system. **LL-37** (also known as cathelicidin) is a key AMP in psoriasis — it is the molecule that accidentally triggers the immune cascade by binding to the body's own DNA, creating complexes that immune cells mistake for a foreign threat.

### 2.4 The HLA System

The **Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)** system is a group of genes on chromosome 6 that encode proteins (known as identity tags) on the surface of cells. These proteins — called **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)** molecules — present fragments of proteins (peptides) to T cells, enabling the immune system to distinguish "self" (the body's own cells) from "non-self" (foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses). Think of MHC molecules as display shelves on the surface of every cell: they hold up samples of whatever is inside the cell for passing T cells to inspect. If a T cell spots something foreign on the shelf, it triggers an immune response. There are two main classes: MHC class I (found on nearly all cells in the body, showing T cells what's happening inside the cell) and MHC class II (found mainly on specialised immune cells, showing T cells what threats have been found in the environment). Variations in HLA genes profoundly influence susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis — because different HLA variants present different peptides, some variants may accidentally present the body's own proteins in a way that triggers an immune attack.

## 3. Epidemiology

### 3.1 Global Prevalence

Psoriasis affects approximately 2–3% of the global population, though prevalence varies considerably by geography, ethnicity, and age. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, there were approximately 42.98 million prevalent cases and 5.10 million new cases of psoriasis worldwide in 2021, with the global burden having nearly doubled since 1990 [(Xiong et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12283580/).

The Global Psoriasis Atlas 2024 update estimated the crude lifetime prevalence for adults in high-income countries at 1.40%, with wide geographic variation [(Dimmock, Aalemi et al., 2024)](https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article/191/Supplement_3/ljae360.061/7916197). A systematic review of worldwide epidemiology found adult prevalence ranged from 0.51% to 11.43% across different populations, and from 0% to 1.37% in children [(Michalek et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27573025/).

### 3.2 Geographic Variation

Psoriasis prevalence is notably higher in regions further from the equator. Norway has one of the highest recorded prevalence rates at approximately 4.6%, with even higher rates (6.1%) in its northern regions — possibly due to reduced sunlight exposure and lower vitamin D levels [(Dairov et al., 2024)](https://www.clinmedkaz.org/download/prevalence-incidence-gender-and-age-distribution-and-economic-burden-of-psoriasis-worldwide-and-in-14497.pdf). The United Kingdom reports a prevalence of approximately 2.8%. In contrast, psoriasis is relatively rare in certain East Asian and African populations [(Parisi et al., 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23014338/).

### 3.3 Age and Gender

Psoriasis can present at any age, but incidence peaks bimodally: in early adulthood (ages 15–30) and again in later life (ages 50–60). These two peaks correspond to what is sometimes classified as **Type 1 psoriasis** (early onset, typically before age 40, strongly associated with HLA-C*06:02 and family history) and **Type 2 psoriasis** (late onset, after age 40, weaker genetic association) [(Capon, 2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9128944/). The overall disease burden is slightly higher in men, though certain regions show higher female prevalence, particularly in East and South Asia [(Xiong et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12283580/).

## 4. Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

### 4.1 Types of Psoriasis

Psoriasis encompasses several clinical variants:

- **Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)**: The most common form, accounting for approximately 80–90% of cases. It presents as well-demarcated, raised, erythematous (red) plaques covered with silvery-white scales, typically on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.
- **Guttate psoriasis**: Characterised by small, droplet-shaped lesions scattered across the trunk and limbs. Often triggered by streptococcal throat infection, particularly in young adults.
- **Inverse (flexural) psoriasis**: Affects skin folds (axillae, groin, submammary areas) with smooth, red, inflamed patches lacking the typical scaling.
- **Pustular psoriasis**: Features sterile (non-infectious) pustules. Can be localised (palmoplantar pustulosis) or generalised (a medical emergency). Generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP) has a distinct genetic and immunological profile involving the IL-36 pathway.
- **Erythrodermic psoriasis**: A rare, severe form involving widespread inflammation and erythema covering most of the body surface. It can be life-threatening and requires urgent medical attention.
- **Nail psoriasis**: Affects fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, discolouration, onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), and subungual hyperkeratosis. Present in up to 50% of patients with plaque psoriasis.

### 4.2 Histopathology (What Psoriatic Skin Looks Like Under a Microscope)

Under the microscope, psoriatic skin shows characteristic features: acanthosis (thickening of the epidermis — the skin's outer layer), elongation of rete ridges (finger-like projections of the epidermis pushing down into the dermis — the deeper skin layer), dilated and tortuous (swollen and twisted) blood vessels in the dermal papillae (the bumpy upper surface of the dermis), a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (a collection of various immune cells that have migrated into the tissue) of T cells and dendritic cells in the dermis, and collections of neutrophils called Munro microabscesses (tiny pockets of white blood cells) in the epidermis [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

### 4.3 Measurement of Severity

Disease severity is commonly measured using the **Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)**, which scores redness, thickness, scaling, and the percentage of body surface area affected, on a scale from 0 to 72. A PASI score below 10 generally indicates mild disease, while scores above 10 indicate moderate-to-severe disease. Treatment efficacy in clinical trials is typically reported as the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 (75% improvement), PASI 90, or PASI 100 (complete clearance). The **Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)** measures the impact on quality of life [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

## 5. Diagnostic Testing and Investigations

Psoriasis is primarily a clinical diagnosis — in most cases, an experienced dermatologist can diagnose it by visual examination alone. There is no single blood test that confirms psoriasis. However, a range of investigations play important roles in confirming uncertain diagnoses, ruling out conditions that mimic psoriasis, identifying triggers, screening for comorbidities, guiding treatment selection, and monitoring drug safety. This section covers the full diagnostic toolkit.

### 5.1 Clinical Examination

The first and most important "test" is a thorough physical examination by a dermatologist. The clinician examines the skin for characteristic features: well-demarcated (clearly bordered), erythematous (red), scaly plaques, typically distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces (elbows, knees), the scalp, lower back, and gluteal cleft. Two classic clinical signs are used:

- **Auspitz sign**: When the silvery scale is gently removed from a plaque, tiny pinpoint bleeding spots appear within seconds. This occurs because the dermis's dilated capillaries are now exposed through the thinned suprapapillary epidermis. While not entirely specific to psoriasis, it is strongly suggestive.
- **Koebner phenomenon**: New psoriatic lesions developing at sites of skin injury (a cut, scratch, or sunburn). This occurs in approximately 25–30% of patients and supports the diagnosis.

The clinician will also ask about family history (psoriasis has ~66% heritability), the pattern of symptom onset, triggers, joint symptoms (to screen for psoriatic arthritis), and the impact on quality of life. Involvement of nails (pitting, onycholysis, oil-drop sign) and the periumbilical region are additional diagnostic clues specific to psoriasis [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

### 5.2 Skin Biopsy

When the clinical picture is ambiguous — for example, in atypical presentations, inverse psoriasis that may resemble fungal infection, or palmoplantar disease that can mimic eczema — a skin biopsy provides definitive confirmation. The procedure is a **punch biopsy** (a small cylindrical tool, typically 4mm in diameter, removes a core of skin including epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat). The sample is examined under a microscope by a pathologist (histopathology — what tissue looks like under a microscope). The results are typically available within a week.

Characteristic histological features of psoriasis include [(PMC, 2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7122924/):

- **Acanthosis**: Thickening of the epidermis, with elongated rete ridges.
- **Parakeratosis**: Retention of cell nuclei in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of skin), indicating abnormally rapid keratinocyte turnover — cells are moving through the epidermis so quickly that they retain their nuclei instead of shedding them.
- **Loss of the granular layer**: The normal transitional layer between living and dead skin cells is absent.
- **Munro's microabscesses**: Collections of neutrophils (white blood cells) trapped within the parakeratotic stratum corneum. Found in approximately 75% of cases and highly characteristic.
- **Spongiform pustules of Kogoj**: Clusters of neutrophils between keratinocytes in the spinous layer of the epidermis.
- **Dilated, tortuous capillaries** in the dermal papillae.
- **Perivascular inflammatory infiltrate**: Collections of T lymphocytes and other immune cells around blood vessels in the dermis.

Biopsy has an accuracy rate of approximately 83% for psoriasis diagnosis. It is particularly important for ruling out conditions that can closely mimic psoriasis, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides), cutaneous lupus, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and drug reactions.

### 5.3 KOH Preparation and Fungal Culture

A **potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation** is a simple bedside test used when a fungal infection needs to be ruled out. This is particularly relevant for scalp psoriasis (which can resemble tinea capitis — a fungal scalp infection) and palmoplantar psoriasis (which can mimic tinea pedis — athlete's foot). The clinician scrapes a small amount of scale from the lesion, dissolves it in KOH solution on a glass slide, and examines it under a microscope. The presence of fungal hyphae (thread-like fungal structures) rules in a fungal infection; their absence supports (but does not confirm) psoriasis.

A fungal culture can also be performed on the scraped material, but takes 2–4 weeks for results. In unclear cases, a biopsy with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining can definitively distinguish psoriasis from tinea.

### 5.4 Blood Tests — Not Diagnostic, but Essential for Management

No blood test can diagnose or rule out psoriasis. However, blood tests serve three critical roles: ruling out conditions that mimic psoriasis, screening for comorbidities, and monitoring drug safety.

#### 5.4.1 Baseline Blood Tests Before Starting Systemic Therapy

Before initiating immunosuppressive or biologic treatment, clinicians typically order [(Medscape, 2024)](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1943419-workup):

- **Full blood count (FBC/CBC)**: Checks red cells, white cells, and platelets. Important as a baseline before immunosuppressive drugs that can cause myelosuppression (reduced bone marrow function). In pustular psoriasis, the white cell count may show leukocytosis (elevated neutrophils) with lymphopenia (reduced lymphocytes).
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin. Essential before starting methotrexate (which is hepatotoxic — causes liver damage) and important for monitoring during treatment.
- **Kidney function tests**: Urea, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Essential before starting ciclosporin (which is nephrotoxic — causes kidney damage).
- **Hepatitis B and C screening**: Biologic therapies suppress the immune system and can reactivate latent hepatitis. Screening is mandatory before starting any biologic.
- **HIV screening**: May be ordered when erythrodermic (whole-body) psoriasis is present, as HIV can present with severe psoriasiform skin eruptions.
- **Pregnancy test**: Required before starting teratogenic medications (those that cause birth defects), including methotrexate, acitretin, and some biologics.

#### 5.4.2 Tuberculosis (TB) Screening

Because biologic therapies — particularly TNF-α inhibitors — can reactivate latent tuberculosis, TB screening is mandatory before starting any biologic. Two tests are used:

- **Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST)**: A small amount of tuberculin protein is injected under the forearm skin. After 48–72 hours, the injection site is examined. A raised, firm swelling above a threshold size (typically ≥5mm in immunosuppressed patients) indicates prior TB exposure.
- **Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)**: A blood test (e.g. QuantiFERON-TB Gold) that measures immune cell response to TB-specific antigens. More specific than the Mantoux test and does not require a follow-up visit.

If either test is positive, a **chest X-ray** is ordered to check for active pulmonary TB. Patients with latent TB can still receive biologics but must complete a course of prophylactic anti-TB treatment first.

#### 5.4.3 Inflammatory Markers

While not diagnostic, several inflammatory blood markers are typically elevated in psoriasis and can help assess systemic inflammatory burden:

- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: An acute-phase protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Elevated in moderate-to-severe psoriasis and useful for monitoring systemic inflammation.
- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**: Another non-specific marker of inflammation, often elevated in psoriatic arthritis.
- **IL-6, TNF-α, E-selectin, ICAM-1**: Research has shown these are elevated in psoriasis patients compared to controls, but the overlap between healthy and affected individuals is too large for diagnostic use. These remain research tools rather than clinical diagnostics.

#### 5.4.4 Metabolic and Cardiovascular Screening

Given that psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease with significant metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities (Section 10), clinical guidelines recommend screening for:

- **Fasting glucose and/or HbA1c**: To screen for diabetes and insulin resistance, which are more prevalent in psoriasis patients.
- **Lipid panel** (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides): To assess cardiovascular risk. Dyslipidemia (unhealthy blood fat levels) is common in psoriasis.
- **Blood pressure**: Hypertension is a recognised psoriasis comorbidity.
- **Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference**: Obesity worsens psoriasis severity and reduces treatment response.

These tests do not diagnose psoriasis but are essential for comprehensive care, as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of excess mortality in severe psoriasis patients.

#### 5.4.5 Coeliac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity Screening

As discussed in Section 9.4, a subgroup of psoriasis patients with gluten sensitivity may benefit from a gluten-free diet. Screening involves:

- **IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies**: The recommended first-line test for coeliac disease.
- **IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA)**: Highly specific confirmatory test.
- **IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies (AGA)**: Used in some studies to identify the broader subgroup of psoriasis patients with gluten sensitivity who may benefit from dietary intervention, even if they do not have full coeliac disease.

Routine screening of all psoriasis patients for coeliac markers is not currently recommended by guidelines, but it is reasonable to test patients who report gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, bloating, fatigue, unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia) or who have refractory psoriasis that does not respond well to standard treatments [(Bhatia et al., 2014)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4104239/).

### 5.5 Joint Assessment and Imaging for Psoriatic Arthritis

Since approximately 30% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), screening for joint involvement is an important part of evaluation. Several tools exist:

#### 5.5.1 Clinical Screening Questionnaires

- **PEST (Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool)**: A validated 5-question questionnaire administered to psoriasis patients to identify those who should be referred to rheumatology for PsA assessment. Questions cover joint pain, swelling, a history of joint disease, and nail problems.

#### 5.5.2 Blood Tests for PsA

- **Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies**: These are typically *negative* in PsA but positive in rheumatoid arthritis. Their main value is in ruling out RA when a patient presents with joint symptoms.
- **HLA-B27**: A genetic marker found on white blood cell surfaces. Positive in approximately 20–25% of PsA patients (compared to ~8% of the general population). It is particularly associated with axial PsA (spine involvement). However, it is not specific enough to diagnose PsA on its own [(Arthritis Foundation, 2026)](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/tests-to-diagnose-and-track-psoriatic-arthritis).
- **Uric acid levels**: Elevated uric acid can indicate gout, which can coexist with or mimic PsA. Testing helps distinguish between the two conditions.

#### 5.5.3 Imaging

- **X-rays**: Can show characteristic PsA changes including joint erosion, new bone formation ("pencil-in-cup" deformity), and joint space narrowing. However, X-rays only detect damage that has already occurred and are normal in early PsA.
- **Ultrasound (musculoskeletal)**: Can detect synovitis (joint inflammation), enthesitis (inflammation where tendons attach to bone), and early erosions that are invisible on X-ray. Increasingly used as a first-line imaging tool because it is radiation-free, widely available, and can be performed during a clinic appointment.
- **MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)**: The most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early PsA. It can identify bone marrow oedema (swelling within the bone), synovitis, tenosynovitis (tendon sheath inflammation), and enthesitis before structural damage is visible. MRI of the sacroiliac joints is particularly important when axial PsA is suspected. Its main limitation is cost and availability.

### 5.6 Dermoscopy

Dermoscopy (also called dermatoscopy) is a non-invasive technique using a handheld magnifying device with a light source to examine skin structures not visible to the naked eye. In psoriasis, dermoscopy reveals a characteristic pattern of uniformly distributed dotted vessels (dilated capillary loops in the dermal papillae) on a light red background, often with white scales. This pattern helps distinguish psoriasis from other conditions like eczema (which shows irregularly distributed vessels) or dermatitis.

Dermoscopy is particularly valuable for nail psoriasis, where it can detect pitting, onycholysis (nail lifting), and splinter haemorrhages more reliably than visual inspection alone.

### 5.7 Pharmacogenomic Testing — The Future of Treatment Selection

While not yet routine clinical practice, genetic testing for the **HLA-C*06:02 allele** is the most studied pharmacogenomic biomarker in psoriasis and has been shown to predict differential response to biologic therapies. The largest study to date (1,326 patients, from the British PSORT Consortium) found that [(Dand et al., 2019)](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(18)32780-5/fulltext):

- **HLA-C*06:02-negative patients** were significantly more likely to respond to adalimumab (anti-TNF-α) than to ustekinumab (anti-IL-12/23), with an odds ratio of 2.95 at 6 months.
- **HLA-C*06:02-positive patients** showed no significant difference in response between the two drugs.
- Among biologic-naïve, PsA-negative patients, being HLA-C*06:02-positive was associated with significantly poorer response to adalimumab at 12 months.

The clinical implication is that knowing a patient's HLA-C*06:02 status could help guide the choice between anti-TNF and anti-IL-12/23 therapies, potentially avoiding months of trial-and-error. However, current clinical guidelines do not yet recommend routine HLA-C*06:02 testing because the evidence, while suggestive, requires further validation in prospective trials and because the newest IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors (which are increasingly used as first-line biologics) have not been as extensively studied for this genetic association [(Precision Clinical Medicine, 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/pcm/article/2/2/120/5522496).

Other pharmacogenomic markers under investigation include polymorphisms in TNF-α, TNFAIP3, IL-17F, IL-23R, and ERAP1 genes, as well as genome-wide approaches to predict methotrexate response, but none are ready for clinical implementation.

### 5.8 Investigations to Rule Out Triggers

Several investigations can help identify factors that may have triggered or may be exacerbating psoriasis:

- **Throat swab and ASO titre**: In guttate psoriasis (particularly in children and young adults), a throat swab for Group A streptococcus culture and a blood test for antistreptolysin O (ASO) titre can confirm a preceding streptococcal infection. Elevated ASO titres are common in guttate psoriasis and, interestingly, are associated with a better prognosis (higher chance of spontaneous remission — see Section 10.2).
- **Drug history review**: Several medications can trigger or worsen psoriasis, including beta-blockers, lithium, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), NSAIDs (particularly indomethacin), and rapid corticosteroid withdrawal. A thorough medication history is an essential "investigation."
- **Vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D)**: Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in psoriasis patients than the general population, and low levels are associated with greater disease severity. While supplementation alone is unlikely to clear psoriasis, addressing deficiency is recommended as part of holistic management.
- **Thyroid function tests**: Autoimmune thyroid disease occurs at higher rates in psoriasis patients. Thyroid screening (TSH, free T4) is appropriate if symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are present.
- **Dental and ENT assessment**: Chronic periodontal disease and chronic tonsillitis have been identified as potential ongoing triggers for psoriasis. Recent research suggests that treating periodontitis may improve psoriasis outcomes. In patients with recurrent guttate psoriasis linked to streptococcal tonsillitis, tonsillectomy may be considered (though evidence from large controlled trials is lacking).

## 6. Genetics of Psoriasis

### 5.1 Heritability

Psoriasis has a strong genetic component. More than 20% of patients report a family history of the disease, and concordance (the likelihood that both twins have the disease) is significantly higher in monozygotic (identical) twins than dizygotic (fraternal) twins. Overall heritability (the proportion of disease risk attributable to genetics rather than environment) is estimated at approximately 66% [(Dand et al., 2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56719-8). However, psoriasis is a polygenic disease — meaning no single gene is sufficient to cause it. Instead, it arises from the cumulative effects of many genetic variants, each contributing a small increase in risk, interacting with environmental factors.

### 5.2 The PSORS1 Locus and HLA-C*06:02

The strongest genetic risk factor for psoriasis is the **HLA-C*06:02** allele (a specific variant of a gene — humans carry two copies of most genes, and an "allele" is one particular version of that gene), located within the **PSORS1** (Psoriasis Susceptibility 1) locus (a specific position on a chromosome) on chromosome 6p21. This region lies within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I interval. HLA-C encodes a protein that presents peptide fragments to CD8+ T cells, enabling immune surveillance.

Studies have consistently shown that carrying one copy of HLA-C*06:02 increases psoriasis risk by approximately 206%, and the allele accounts for the single largest genetic effect in the disease [(Chen et al., 2011; cited in Gelfand et al., 2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2023.1141010/full). However, HLA-C*06:02 only explains approximately 6.7% of the total genetic heritability of psoriasis, indicating that many other genes contribute to disease risk [(Chen et al., 2011; cited in Gelfand et al., 2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2023.1141010/full).

The PSORS1 locus has the largest effect size and accounts for 35–50% of disease heritability explained by known loci [(Capon, 2020)](https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/html/10.2340/00015555-3384). HLA-C*06:02 is strongly associated with Type 1 (early-onset) psoriasis and is validated as the primary susceptibility allele in both European and East Asian populations, though it has a very low allele frequency in Japanese populations, where other HLA alleles such as HLA-A*02:07 predominate [(Li et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/pcm/article/2/2/120/5522496).

### 5.3 Beyond PSORS1: The Broader Genetic Landscape

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS — large-scale studies that scan the entire genome of thousands of people to find genetic variants associated with a disease) have identified a growing number of psoriasis susceptibility loci (specific locations in the genome where genetic variation is linked to disease risk). A 2025 meta-analysis of 18 GWAS comprising 36,466 cases and 458,078 controls identified 109 distinct susceptibility loci, including 46 not previously reported [(Dand et al., 2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56719-8). These loci implicate several key biological pathways:

- **The IL-23/IL-17 signalling axis**: Variants in genes encoding IL-23 receptor (IL23R), IL-12B (shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23), IL-23A (p19 subunit of IL-23), and IL-17RA have been identified, providing genetic evidence for the central role of this pathway in psoriasis and validating the targets of current biologic therapies.
- **NF-κB signalling**: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription factor (a protein that switches genes on or off) that controls the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes. Variants in TNFAIP3, TNIP1, CARD14, and REL — all involved in NF-κB regulation — are associated with psoriasis risk.
- **Type I interferon signalling**: Variants in genes involved in interferon production and response, including IFIH1 and TYK2.
- **Skin barrier function**: Deletions in the late cornified envelope genes LCE3B and LCE3C, which encode proteins involved in the terminal differentiation of the skin's outermost layer, are associated with psoriasis susceptibility [(Riveira-Munoz et al., 2011; cited in El-Boghdady et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10418823/).
- **Antigen processing**: The interaction between HLA-C and **ERAP1** (Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1) — an enzyme that trims proteins into the right size for display on MHC class I molecules — provides evidence that the way cells present internal protein fragments to the immune system may go wrong in psoriasis, causing T cells to attack skin cells [(Strange et al., 2010)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3749730/).

### 5.4 Pharmacogenomics (Using Genetics to Guide Treatment)

Genetic information is beginning to inform treatment decisions. Patients positive for HLA-C*06:02 demonstrate better response to the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab than HLA-C*06:02-negative patients, particularly during the initial months of treatment [(Capon, 2020)](https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/html/10.2340/00015555-3384). A risk score of 200 genetic markers has shown promise in predicting the development of psoriatic arthritis in patients with skin psoriasis [(Capon, 2020)](https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/html/10.2340/00015555-3384).

## 7. Immunopathogenesis: How Psoriasis Develops

The pathogenesis of psoriasis involves a complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells, keratinocytes, and a network of cytokines. The current model can be understood in three overlapping phases: initiation, amplification, and chronic maintenance.

> **📎 Visual companion:** An interactive illustrated guide to the mechanisms below — including skin cross-section diagrams, the inflammatory cascade, and the self-amplifying feedback loop — is provided in the accompanying file `visual-guide.html`.

### 6.0 The Everyday Analogy

Before diving into molecular detail, here is a simplified analogy that captures the essence of psoriasis pathogenesis:

> **The Factory Analogy:** Think of your skin as a conveyor belt in a factory. Normally, new tiles (skin cells) are placed on the belt at one end and gently fall off the other end at a steady pace — about one full cycle every 28 days. In psoriasis, someone has cranked the belt speed to 10×. Tiles pile up at the end because they can't fall off fast enough. Meanwhile, an overzealous security team (the immune system) keeps sounding false alarms, calling in more and more workers — making everything worse. The result: a chaotic pile-up that's red, raised, and inflamed. Biologic drugs work by silencing specific members of that security team.

### 6.1 The Pathogenic Triad

Emerging evidence identifies three cell types as constituting a central "pathogenic triad" in psoriasis: **dendritic cells**, **Th17 cells**, and **keratinocytes** [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/).

- Dendritic cells produce TNF-α and IL-23, promoting T cell differentiation toward Th17 cells.
- Th17 cells produce the key psoriatic cytokines IL-17, IFN-γ, and IL-22.
- Keratinocytes respond to these cytokines by proliferating excessively and producing their own inflammatory mediators, including chemokines that recruit more immune cells, creating a self-sustaining cycle.

### 6.2 Phase 1: Initiation

In genetically predisposed individuals, a trigger event — such as physical trauma to the skin (the **Koebner phenomenon**), streptococcal infection, stress, or certain medications — sets off the initial immune cascade [(Griffiths et al., 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32549-6/abstract).

In the early phase, damaged or stressed keratinocytes release self-DNA and the antimicrobial peptide **LL-37**. LL-37 binds to self-DNA, forming complexes that are normally ignored by the immune system. However, in psoriasis-susceptible individuals, these LL-37–DNA complexes activate **plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)** via Toll-like receptors (TLR7 and TLR9) — pattern-recognition sensors on immune cells that detect molecular signatures typically associated with viruses or bacteria. This activation stimulates pDCs to produce large quantities of **type I interferons (IFN-α)** — powerful alarm signals that put the broader immune system on high alert [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

Simultaneously, **neutrophils** infiltrate the skin early in the process, releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs — web-like structures made of DNA that neutrophils expel to trap pathogens), exosomes (tiny parcels of signalling molecules), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9 — an enzyme that breaks down tissue to allow immune cells to move through it), and IL-17 [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/).

> **The False Fire Alarm:** Imagine LL-37/DNA complexes as burnt toast smoke. In most people, the smoke detector (pDC) briefly beeps and resets. In someone with psoriasis-susceptibility genes, the smoke detector is hypersensitive — it triggers the full building fire alarm (IFN-α), calling every fire engine in town.

### 6.3 Phase 2: Amplification — The IL-23/Th17 Axis

IFN-α produced by pDCs activates **myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs)**, which then produce two critical cytokines: **IL-12** and **IL-23**.

- **IL-12** drives the differentiation of naïve T cells into **Th1 cells**, which produce IFN-γ and TNF-α.
- **IL-23** is central to the survival and proliferation of **Th17 cells** and **Th22 cells**.

Th17 cells are now recognised as the dominant pathogenic T cell subset in psoriasis. They produce:
- **IL-17A**: The most important effector cytokine in psoriasis. IL-17A acts directly on keratinocytes, inducing them to produce a broad array of pro-inflammatory chemokines (CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL8), antimicrobial peptides (LL-37, β-defensins), and cytokines, while simultaneously promoting keratinocyte hyperproliferation.
- **IL-22**: Promotes epidermal thickening (acanthosis) by stimulating keratinocyte proliferation and inhibiting normal differentiation.
- **TNF-α**: Amplifies inflammation by synergising with IL-17A.

This creates a **self-amplifying "feed-forward" inflammatory loop**: IL-17 stimulates keratinocytes to produce CCL20, which attracts more CCR6-expressing Th17 cells to the skin; these Th17 cells produce more IL-17, and the cycle continues and escalates [(Hawkes et al., 2017)](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(17)31197-1/fulltext).

> **The Chain Reaction:** IL-23 is like a drill sergeant turning recruits (naïve T cells) into a specialised assault force (Th17 cells). Those soldiers produce IL-17A — which is like a megaphone that tells the factory workers (keratinocytes) to speed up production AND to broadcast recruitment ads for more soldiers. Each new soldier brings another megaphone. This is why the response escalates so quickly.

### 6.4 Phase 3: Chronic Maintenance and Immunological Memory

In established psoriatic plaques, the inflammatory response becomes self-sustaining. The continuous cross-talk between immune cells and keratinocytes maintains the characteristic features of psoriasis: epidermal hyperproliferation (skin cells dividing far too rapidly), aberrant differentiation (skin cells failing to mature properly), new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis — the growth of new blood vessels, which deliver more immune cells and nutrients to sustain the plaque), and persistent immune cell infiltration.

A critical concept in understanding psoriasis chronicity is the role of **tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells)**. These are a subset of T cells that persist in previously affected skin long after plaques have clinically resolved. IL-17A-producing CD8+ TRM cells are associated with early relapse of psoriasis after therapy is discontinued [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/). Additionally, IL-17-producing γδ (gamma-delta) T cells — a specialised and relatively rare subset of T cells that are particularly common in barrier tissues like the skin, where they act as early sentinels — have been shown to persist in previously psoriatic skin and establish a memory population capable of reinitiating disease [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/).

This immunological memory helps explain why psoriasis tends to recur in the same locations and why complete, durable remission is difficult to achieve.

> **The Immune System's "Sticky Note":** TRM cells are like sticky notes left on the inside of your skin that say "there was a problem here." Even after treatment clears a plaque, the notes remain. Any small provocation causes the immune system to read the note and restart the entire inflammatory programme — which is why psoriasis keeps coming back to the same spots.

### 6.5 Other Cells and Pathways

While the DC–Th17–keratinocyte triad is the core of the current pathogenic model, numerous other cells and signalling pathways contribute:

- **Th9 cells** and **Th22 cells** contribute additional cytokines to the inflammatory milieu.
- **Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**, particularly group 3 ILCs, are an innate source of IL-17 and IL-22 in psoriatic skin.
- **Mast cells** are increased in psoriatic lesions and may contribute to both inflammation and angiogenesis.
- **The NF-κB pathway**: A key intracellular signalling cascade that controls the expression of many pro-inflammatory genes in both immune cells and keratinocytes [(Gopika et al., 2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320524005812).
- **The JAK-STAT pathway**: An intracellular signalling relay system that operates inside cells, downstream of many cytokine receptors. When a cytokine (like IL-23) lands on a cell's surface receptor, JAK enzymes (Janus kinases) inside the cell activate STAT proteins, which then travel to the cell's nucleus to switch specific genes on or off. This pathway is a key mechanism through which cytokines exert their effects, and it is the target of newer "small molecule" drugs [(Gopika et al., 2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320524005812).
- **The gut-skin axis**: The gut microbiome (the trillions of bacteria living in the intestines) is increasingly recognised as playing a role in psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis show altered gut microbiota composition — a state called dysbiosis (an unhealthy imbalance of gut bacteria) — and increased gut barrier permeability (a "leaky gut"), which may allow bacterial products to escape into the bloodstream and fuel systemic inflammation [(Al-Kufi et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12047224/).

## 8. Environmental Triggers

Psoriasis develops when environmental factors interact with genetic susceptibility to initiate or exacerbate the immune cascade described above. The following triggers are well-characterised in the literature.

### 7.1 Infections

**Streptococcal infection** (particularly pharyngitis/strep throat) is the best-established infectious trigger for psoriasis and is especially linked to the onset of guttate psoriasis. Streptococcal M protein shares structural similarity with keratin in human skin, potentially leading to cross-reactive T cell activation — a form of molecular mimicry (where the immune system confuses a bacterial protein with a similar-looking human protein, and attacks both) [(Griffiths et al., 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32549-6/abstract). Other infections, including HIV, may also trigger or exacerbate psoriasis.

### 7.2 Obesity

Obesity is both a risk factor for developing psoriasis and a factor that worsens existing disease. Adipose tissue (body fat) is metabolically active and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines called adipokines (signalling molecules released specifically by fat cells), including TNF-α and IL-6, which contribute to systemic inflammation. Obesity also reduces the efficacy of many psoriasis treatments, and weight loss has been shown to improve disease severity and treatment response [(Zhu et al., 2024; Al-Kufi et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12047224/).

### 7.3 Psychological Stress

Stress is one of the most commonly cited triggers for psoriasis flares, reported by a significant proportion of patients. The mechanism may involve promotion of neurogenic inflammation (inflammation triggered by the nervous system), changes in the neuroendocrine system — particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the body's central stress-response system connecting the brain to the adrenal glands — and redistribution of immune cells to the skin [(Ko et al., 2019; cited in Masson et al., 2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6629583/).

### 7.4 Smoking

Smoking is an independent risk factor for psoriasis onset and severity. Tobacco smoke causes oxidative stress and free radical production, interfering with signalling pathways relevant to psoriasis including NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT [(Naldi, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5683129/). Smokers with psoriasis also show reduced treatment response. One study found that patients with longer smoking duration and higher smoking intensity had significantly lower rates of achieving PASI 75 after eight weeks of treatment [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Tobacco-smoking-negatively-influences-the-achievement-of-greater-than-three-quarters,184143,0,2.html). Smoking also alters the gut microbiota in ways that may promote psoriatic inflammation [(Luca et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110215/).

### 7.5 Alcohol

Excessive alcohol consumption increases the expression of TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and plasma levels of TNF-α receptor, upregulates genes promoting lymphocyte and keratinocyte proliferation, and may facilitate skin infections that act as psoriasis triggers. Alcohol misuse affects approximately one-third of people with psoriasis and worsens therapeutic compliance [(Brenaut et al., 2022; cited in Caso et al., 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541512/).

### 7.6 Medications

Several classes of medications can trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, including **beta-blockers**, **lithium**, **antimalarials** (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine), **interferon-alpha**, **ACE inhibitors**, and rapid withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids [(Griffiths et al., 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32549-6/abstract).

### 7.7 Physical Trauma (Koebner Phenomenon)

Skin injury — cuts, burns, tattoos, surgical wounds, or even friction — can trigger psoriatic lesions at the site of trauma. This is known as the **Koebner phenomenon** or isomorphic response, and it occurs in approximately 25–50% of psoriasis patients.

### 7.8 Climate and UV Exposure

Cold, dry climates are associated with worsening psoriasis, while moderate sunlight exposure (particularly UV-B radiation) can improve symptoms — forming the basis for phototherapy treatments. However, sunburn can trigger flares. The geographic gradient of psoriasis prevalence (higher at higher latitudes) may partly reflect reduced UV exposure and lower vitamin D levels [(Dairov et al., 2024)](https://www.clinmedkaz.org/download/prevalence-incidence-gender-and-age-distribution-and-economic-burden-of-psoriasis-worldwide-and-in-14497.pdf).

---

## 9. Lifestyle, Diet, and Home Remedies: What Does the Evidence Say?

Psoriasis patients frequently seek complementary and alternative approaches, either alongside or instead of conventional treatment. Given the chronic nature of the disease, it is understandable that people want to explore every option. However, the quality of evidence for most lifestyle interventions varies enormously — from well-powered randomised controlled trials to anecdotal reports. This section summarises the current state of the science.

### 8.1 Weight Loss — Strong Evidence

Weight loss is the lifestyle intervention with the strongest evidence base in psoriasis. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (1,145 participants) published in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology found that weight-loss interventions produced a mean PASI reduction of 2.5 points more than controls (95% CI: −3.8 to −1.1), and that participants who lost weight were 1.6 times more likely to achieve PASI 75 [(Morrow et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41416383/). The meta-analysis included dietary interventions, exercise programmes, and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (the class of drugs that includes semaglutide/Ozempic). The authors concluded with "high-certainty evidence" that weight-loss interventions improve both psoriasis severity and quality of life. A separate long-term follow-up study found that these benefits persist: patients who maintained weight loss for 64 weeks continued to show reduced psoriasis severity [(Jensen et al., 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522045373).

The biological rationale is well-established: adipose tissue (body fat) produces pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6, which feed into the same inflammatory pathways that drive psoriasis. Additionally, obesity reduces the efficacy of biologic therapies, meaning that weight loss can improve treatment response.

**Evidence grade: High. Recommended as adjunct therapy by clinical guidelines.**

### 8.2 Mediterranean Diet — Moderate Evidence (Growing)

The Mediterranean diet — rich in olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, and low in processed food and red meat — has shown promising results. The first randomised clinical trial specifically evaluating a structured Mediterranean diet programme for psoriasis (the MEDIPSO trial, 2025) found that a 16-week dietitian-guided Mediterranean diet intervention produced a 3.4-point greater PASI reduction than a standard low-fat diet — and this improvement was independent of weight loss [(Perez-Bootello et al., 2025)](https://www.healio.com/news/dermatology/20251003/intensive-mediterranean-diet-may-yield-significant-improvement-in-psoriasis-symptoms). The intervention group also showed improvements in HbA1c (a marker of blood sugar control) and anxiety.

Prior to this trial, evidence came mainly from observational studies, including a large French survey of 35,735 patients that found an association between severe psoriasis and low adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet (particularly omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and fibre) provide a plausible biological mechanism.

**Evidence grade: Moderate, with the first RCT published in 2025. Promising but more trials needed.**

### 8.3 Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil) — Mixed Evidence

Fish oil supplementation has been studied multiple times with contradictory results. An 8-week double-blind study of 28 patients found significant improvement in itching, redness, and scaling — but not in the size of patches. However, a larger double-blind study of 145 patients over 4 months found no benefit compared to placebo [(EBSCO Research, 2024)](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/complementary-and-alternative-medicine/natural-treatments-psoriasis). A 2025 systematic review concluded that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation "may be associated with improved psoriasis outcomes" but that evidence quality remains low [(Li et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026156142500041X).

**Evidence grade: Low to moderate. Conflicting trial results. May have modest benefit as adjunct therapy but is not a standalone treatment.**

### 8.4 Gluten-Free Diet — Conditional Evidence

A gluten-free diet has been shown to benefit a specific subgroup of psoriasis patients: those who test positive for antigliadin antibodies (a marker of gluten sensitivity). In one study, 73% of antibody-positive patients saw significant PASI improvement after 3 months on a gluten-free diet, while none of the antibody-negative patients improved [(Michaëlsson et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14690336/). A 2018 study by Kolchak et al. found 56% and 36% PASI improvement in patients with very high and high antigliadin antibody levels respectively after one year on a gluten-free diet [(Kolchak et al., 2018; cited in MDPI, 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2316).

However, for psoriasis patients without gluten sensitivity, the available evidence shows no benefit from a gluten-free diet. Screening psoriasis patients for coeliac disease markers may identify the subset who could benefit.

**Evidence grade: Moderate for antigliadin-positive patients. No evidence of benefit for patients without gluten sensitivity.**

### 8.5 Probiotics and the Gut Microbiome — Emerging but Early

Given the emerging research on the gut-skin axis (discussed in Section 7.5), probiotics and prebiotics are attracting interest. A 2025 systematic review found that probiotic and prebiotic supplementation "may be associated with improved psoriasis outcomes," but the number of clinical trials is small and their methodologies are heterogeneous [(Li et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026156142500041X). This area is biologically plausible but requires substantially more clinical data before recommendations can be made.

**Evidence grade: Very low. Biologically plausible but insufficient clinical trial data.**

### 8.6 Topical Herbal and Natural Remedies

A 2025 systematic review published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine evaluated herbal medicines for psoriasis using PRISMA guidelines and found that three natural remedies have the strongest clinical evidence [(Anheyer et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229925000482):

- **Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape)**: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 200 people found that 10% Oregon grape cream produced statistically significant improvement over placebo over 3 months, though it was less effective than standard topical medications.
- **Indigo naturalis** (a traditional Chinese herbal preparation): Several studies have shown efficacy in psoriasis, with active compounds including indirubin, which has been demonstrated to inhibit the JAK3/STAT3 pathway and suppress IL-17A production in laboratory studies.
- **Aloe vera**: A double-blind study of 60 patients found that 0.5% aloe vera cream produced significantly better results than placebo over 4 weeks. However, a follow-up replication study of 40 patients failed to confirm this finding. A 2023 review noted that aloe vera reduced mean PASI scores by 7.7 points in the treatment group.

Other natural remedies commonly discussed include:
- **Curcumin (turmeric)**: Has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory studies, including the ability to modulate TNF-α expression. However, clinical trial data in psoriasis is limited to small studies.
- **Tea tree oil**: No scientific studies have proven effectiveness in psoriasis despite anecdotal reports.
- **Apple cider vinegar**: No clinical evidence of efficacy; can cause skin damage if applied to cracked or broken skin.
- **Colloidal oatmeal baths / Dead Sea salts**: May provide symptomatic relief (itching, scaling) but no evidence of disease modification.

**Evidence grade: Low to moderate for Oregon grape and indigo naturalis; low for aloe vera; very low or no evidence for tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and others.**

### 8.7 Stress Reduction

Stress is a well-documented trigger for psoriasis flares (Section 8.3), and several small studies have explored whether stress-reduction interventions can improve outcomes. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) combined with phototherapy has shown faster skin clearance than phototherapy alone in one small study. However, the evidence base remains limited to small trials and no clinical guideline currently recommends specific stress-reduction protocols for psoriasis management.

**Evidence grade: Low. Biologically plausible but inadequately studied.**

### 8.8 Alcohol and Smoking Cessation

As discussed in Sections 7.4 and 7.5, smoking and alcohol are established risk factors for psoriasis onset, severity, and treatment resistance. While no RCT has directly tested smoking cessation as a psoriasis intervention (for obvious ethical and practical reasons), observational evidence consistently shows that smokers have worse psoriasis outcomes. Smoking cessation and alcohol reduction are recommended by clinical guidelines for all psoriasis patients, both for skin disease and for the associated cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.

**Evidence grade: High (observational). Recommended by clinical guidelines.**

### 8.9 Summary: The Evidence Hierarchy

| Intervention | Evidence Grade | Best Evidence | Recommended? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weight loss | **High** | Multiple RCTs, meta-analyses | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Smoking cessation | **High (observational)** | Consistent observational data | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Alcohol reduction | **Moderate (observational)** | Observational studies | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Mediterranean diet | **Moderate** | 1 RCT (2025) + observational data | Promising — more RCTs needed |
| Gluten-free diet | **Moderate (conditional)** | Small trials in antibody-positive patients | Only if antigliadin antibody-positive |
| Fish oil / omega-3 | **Low–moderate** | Conflicting RCTs | May help as adjunct; not standalone |
| Oregon grape cream | **Low–moderate** | 1 RCT of 200 patients | May help for mild disease |
| Indigo naturalis | **Low–moderate** | Several studies; preclinical mechanism data | May help; more data needed |
| Aloe vera | **Low** | Conflicting trial results | Insufficient evidence |
| Curcumin/turmeric | **Low** | Preclinical + small clinical studies | Insufficient evidence |
| Probiotics | **Very low** | Preliminary only | Insufficient evidence |
| Tea tree oil | **None** | No clinical studies | No evidence |
| Apple cider vinegar | **None** | No clinical studies | No evidence; may cause harm |

> **Important:** None of these lifestyle interventions are a substitute for medical treatment in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation advises patients to discuss any complementary approaches with their dermatologist before use, particularly herbal remedies that may interact with prescribed medications.

## 10. Remission and Spontaneous Clearance

A question frequently asked by newly diagnosed patients is: *can psoriasis go away completely?* The answer is nuanced.

### 9.1 What Is "Remission" in Psoriasis?

There has historically been no standardised definition of remission in psoriasis. A 2022 systematic literature review by the National Psoriasis Foundation identified 41 different definitions of "remission" across 106 studies, ranging from PASI 75 to complete skin clearance [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/). In 2025, the National Psoriasis Foundation published a consensus statement defining "on-treatment remission" as maintaining ≤1% body surface area involvement for at least 6 months, with a DLQI score of 0 or 1 (indicating no impact on quality of life) [(NPF, 2025)](https://www.psoriasis.org/watch-and-listen/defining-on-treatment-remission-abbvie/). Crucially, this definition specifies *on-treatment* remission — it explicitly acknowledges that most patients achieve clearance while continuing medication.

True **drug-free remission** — complete skin clearance sustained for at least 12 months without any therapy — is much rarer and has only been addressed in one small consensus initiative [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/).

### 9.2 Guttate Psoriasis: The Strongest Case for Spontaneous Remission

Guttate psoriasis — the form characterised by sudden eruptions of small, droplet-shaped lesions, often following a streptococcal throat infection — has the best-documented potential for spontaneous resolution. Guttate psoriasis typically follows a predictable course: new lesions develop during the first month, stabilise in the second month, and begin to remit in the third month.

Key findings from the literature:

- A 2023 systematic review reported that guttate psoriasis generally spontaneously remits within 12–16 weeks of onset [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11619194/).
- A retrospective study of 36 patients found that 61.1% achieved complete remission lasting at least 1 year (designated "good prognosis"), while 38.9% had incomplete remission or progressed to chronic plaque psoriasis [(Ko et al., 2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20860740/).
- A larger, long-term follow-up study of 120 patients with new-onset guttate psoriasis (mean follow-up 6.2 years) found that 50.9% achieved complete remission, while 49.1% had persistent psoriatic disease. Of those with persistent disease, 17.5% had switched to the plaque psoriasis phenotype [(Guttman-Yassky et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10015744/).
- Factors associated with *better* prognosis (more likely to fully remit): younger age at onset, preceding streptococcal infection with high ASO titres, and absence of family history of plaque psoriasis.
- Factors associated with *worse* prognosis (more likely to persist): family history of chronic plaque psoriasis, multiple flares (>3), scalp involvement, palmoplantar involvement, and male sex.

In summary: approximately half to two-thirds of first-episode guttate psoriasis patients achieve spontaneous complete remission, documented in peer-reviewed follow-up studies. However, about one-third to one-half go on to develop chronic psoriasis.

### 9.3 Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: Spontaneous Remission Is Rare

For chronic plaque psoriasis — the most common form (80–90% of cases) — spontaneous drug-free remission is uncommon. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of worsening (flares) and improvement, but complete spontaneous clearance without treatment is considered exceptional. When it does occur, it is typically temporary: the American Academy of Dermatology notes that most remission periods last 1–12 months, and data shows that 41% of patients who achieve remission restart medication within one year, rising to 86% within five years [(WebMD, 2025)](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/features/psoriasis-remission-what-to-expect).

The biological explanation for this is the persistence of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) discussed in Section 7.4 — even after visible plaques clear, the immunological "memory" of disease remains embedded in the skin, ready to reinitiate inflammation upon provocation.

### 9.4 On-Treatment Complete Clearance: Increasingly Achievable

While drug-free remission remains elusive for chronic plaque psoriasis, *on-treatment* complete clearance (PASI 100) has become an increasingly realistic goal with modern biologics. The most effective IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. risankizumab) achieve PASI 100 in approximately 40–55% of patients, and newer agents like bimekizumab achieve even higher rates. PASI 90 (near-complete clearance) is achieved in 60–80% of patients on modern biologics. The 2025 consensus statement from dermatologists reflects this shift: the treatment goal has moved from PASI 75 (historically considered "success") to PASI 100, recognising that complete clearance represents deeper suppression of the underlying systemic inflammation and may reduce the risk of psoriatic arthritis [(HCPLive, 2026)](https://www.hcplive.com/view/redefining-treatment-success-and-remission-in-psoriasis-care).

---

## 11. Comorbidities: Psoriasis as a Systemic Disease

Psoriasis is now firmly recognised as a systemic inflammatory condition, associated with a range of comorbidities that extend well beyond the skin. In 2019, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation published comprehensive guidelines identifying the following conditions as psoriasis comorbidities [(National Psoriasis Foundation, 2024)](https://www.psoriasis.org/related-conditions/).

### 8.1 Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)

The most common comorbidity. An estimated 30–33% of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. Skin disease precedes joint disease in the majority of cases. Certain HLA-B alleles, particularly HLA-B*27, are associated with increased PsA risk, whereas HLA-C*06:02 — the major skin psoriasis risk allele — is not specifically linked to PsA [(Capon, 2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9128944/).

### 8.2 Cardiovascular Disease

Patients with severe psoriasis have an elevated risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, atherosclerosis (build-up of fatty plaques inside arteries), and cardiovascular mortality. The chronic systemic inflammation of psoriasis — driven by the same TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis — promotes endothelial dysfunction (damage to the inner lining of blood vessels), insulin resistance, and atherogenesis (the process of artery-clogging plaque formation) through shared inflammatory pathways [(Hu & Lan, 2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/10/2211). A meta-analysis encompassing 42,000 psoriasis patients found the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome was as high as 2.26 [(Mehta et al., 2021)](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.02.009). Intriguingly, treatment with TNF-α inhibitors has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of myocardial infarction in psoriasis patients [(Hu & Lan, 2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/10/2211).

### 8.3 Metabolic Syndrome

Psoriasis is significantly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (unhealthy levels of fats in the blood) — a cluster of conditions known as **metabolic syndrome**. The release of excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 from psoriatic inflammation causes chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, which promotes insulin resistance (where the body's cells stop responding properly to insulin), visceral adiposity (accumulation of fat around internal organs), and dyslipidemia [(Takahashi & Iizuka, 2012)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5519460/). Psoriasis patients have been shown to have up to 15% lower HDL cholesterol and dramatically reduced HDL efflux capacity, with a lipid profile resembling that of diabetic patients [(Mehta et al., 2021)](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.02.009).

### 8.4 Mental Health

Psoriasis significantly affects mental health. Patients are approximately 40% more likely to carry a diagnosis of depression and experience elevated rates of anxiety, social stigma, and reduced quality of life [(Mehta et al., 2021)](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.02.009). The visible nature of the disease contributes to shame, social withdrawal, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation [(Takahashi & Iizuka, 2012)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5519460/).

### 8.5 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Psoriasis and IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) share common immune pathways and genetic susceptibility loci. The prevalence of IBD in psoriasis patients is approximately four times higher than in the general population [(Ni & Chiu, 2014)](https://www.dovepress.com/psoriasis-and-comorbidities-links-and-risks-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID).

### 8.6 Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

NAFLD prevalence is significantly higher in psoriasis patients, particularly those with more severe skin disease. This has important implications for treatment selection, as several systemic psoriasis therapies are hepatotoxic (can cause liver damage) [(Johnson, 2024)](https://dermnppa.org/what-we-know-about-psoriasis-comorbidities-and-their-management/).

### 8.7 The "Psoriatic March" Hypothesis

A unifying hypothesis known as the **"psoriatic march"** proposes that chronic cutaneous (skin-based) inflammation in psoriasis induces systemic inflammation, which leads progressively to insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction (damage to blood vessel linings), atherosclerosis, and ultimately cardiovascular events. This model suggests that effective early treatment of psoriasis may help prevent the cascade of cardiometabolic comorbidities [(Hu & Lan, 2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/10/2211).

## 12. Therapeutic Landscape

### 9.1 Overview of Treatment Approaches

Treatment for psoriasis is stratified by disease severity:

- **Mild disease**: Topical therapies (corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytics).
- **Moderate-to-severe disease**: Phototherapy, conventional systemic agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin), small molecule inhibitors (apremilast, deucravacitinib), and biologic therapies.

The introduction of biologic therapies has revolutionised the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis over the past two decades [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

### 9.2 Biologic Therapies

Biologics are engineered proteins — typically antibodies (immune proteins that bind to and neutralise specific targets) or fusion proteins (lab-created molecules that combine parts of two different proteins) — designed to block specific components of the immune system. Unlike traditional drugs which are small chemical molecules, biologics are large, complex proteins manufactured in living cells. They are grouped by the immune target they block:

#### TNF-α Inhibitors (First Generation)
The first biologics approved for psoriasis. These block TNF-α, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine. While effective, they have been superseded by newer agents with superior efficacy. TNF-α inhibitors remain valuable for patients with concurrent psoriatic arthritis, where they have strong evidence of efficacy, and their long-term safety profile is well-established [(ten Bergen et al., 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sji.12946). Approved agents include:

- **Etanercept (Enbrel)**: A TNF receptor fusion protein (a lab-made molecule that mimics a natural TNF receptor, soaking up TNF like a sponge) given as a weekly subcutaneous injection (injected just under the skin, which patients can do at home). The lowest PASI 90 rates among biologics (~17.9%).
- **Adalimumab (Humira)**: A fully human monoclonal antibody (a lab-made antibody designed to target one specific molecule — in this case TNF-α — "monoclonal" means all copies are identical, and "fully human" means it is made entirely from human protein sequences, reducing the chance of the body rejecting it), given as a subcutaneous injection every two weeks. Once the world's best-selling drug. PASI 90 rates ~45%.
- **Infliximab (Remicade)**: A chimeric monoclonal antibody (part mouse, part human — "chimeric" comes from the mythological chimera, a creature made of different animals) given by intravenous infusion (delivered directly into a vein, requiring a visit to an infusion centre). Rapid onset of action but requires clinic visits.
- **Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia)**: A PEGylated antibody fragment (just the business end of an antibody, coated with a polymer called PEG to make it last longer in the body). Notably, it does not cross the placenta and is therefore considered the preferred biologic option during pregnancy.

#### IL-12/23 Inhibitor
**Ustekinumab (Stelara)** targets the p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, blocking both cytokines. It was the first biologic to target the IL-23 pathway and demonstrated that blocking upstream drivers of Th17 differentiation was highly effective. Administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks after induction, with weight-based dosing (45 mg for patients ≤100 kg, 90 mg for >100 kg) [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

#### IL-17 Inhibitors
These agents target IL-17 or its receptor, providing rapid skin clearance and addressing multiple disease domains including nails and scalp. IL-17 inhibitors achieve PASI 75–100 in 60–90% of patients [(various reviews, 2024–2025)](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-5786/5/2/19). Approved agents include:

- **Secukinumab (Cosentyx)**: A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A. Administered subcutaneously, typically every 4 weeks after a loading phase. Approved for adults and children aged 6+.
- **Ixekizumab (Taltz)**: A humanised monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A. Among the highest PASI 90 response rates of any biologic. Given subcutaneously every 2 weeks during induction, then every 4 weeks.
- **Brodalumab (Siliq)**: Unique in that it targets the IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) rather than the cytokine itself, thereby blocking multiple IL-17 family members (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17C, IL-17E). Carries a boxed warning regarding suicidal ideation, requiring a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programme.
- **Bimekizumab (Bimzelx)**: The newest IL-17 inhibitor (FDA-approved October 2023). Uniquely inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F simultaneously, providing among the highest skin clearance rates in clinical trials. Given subcutaneously every 4 weeks during induction, then every 8 weeks.

The main safety consideration with IL-17 inhibitors is an elevated risk of mucocutaneous candidiasis (yeast infections of mucosal surfaces), due to IL-17's physiological role in mucosal antifungal defence. There is also emerging evidence of a potential link between IL-17 inhibition and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, making IL-17 inhibitors less suitable for patients with concurrent IBD [(Fatani et al., 2025)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14712598.2025.2495986).

#### IL-23 Inhibitors (Selective p19)
These selectively target the p19 subunit unique to IL-23, blocking IL-23 without affecting IL-12. They represent the current state of the art for psoriasis treatment, offering superior efficacy in clinical trials with an excellent safety profile and extended dosing intervals [(Fatani et al., 2025)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14712598.2025.2495986). A comparative review supports IL-23 inhibitors as the most effective biological therapy class for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with IL-17 inhibitors as a strong alternative [(IJFMR, 2024)](https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/29806.pdf). Approved agents include:

- **Guselkumab (Tremfya)**: The first selective IL-23 inhibitor approved for psoriasis. Administered subcutaneously every 8 weeks after induction. Also approved for psoriatic arthritis.
- **Risankizumab (Skyrizi)**: Manufactured by AbbVie. Achieves the highest PASI 90 response rates (~71.6%) among all studied biologics. Given subcutaneously every 12 weeks after induction — the longest dosing interval of any injectable psoriasis biologic. Also approved for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease.
- **Tildrakizumab (Ilumya)**: Administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks after induction. Shown to be the safest biologic among IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors in meta-analysis, with the lowest adverse event rates, though its efficacy builds more gradually than some competitors, reaching comparable levels by week 28.

#### IL-36 Receptor Antagonist
**Spesolimab (Spevigo)** targets the IL-36 receptor and is specifically indicated for generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP), which has a distinct pathogenesis involving the IL-36 pathway rather than the IL-23/IL-17 axis [(PMC, 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/).

### 9.3 Pricing and Cost Considerations

The cost of biologic therapies for psoriasis is substantial and has risen over time, creating a major barrier to access. A 2025 study published in *JAMA Dermatology* analysing US commercial insurance data from 2007 to 2021 found that the average annual cost of biologic treatment for psoriasis jumped from approximately $21,000 in 2007 to over $47,000 in 2021 [(Rome et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40238112/).

A separate economic evaluation in *JAMA Dermatology* found that as of January 2023, US net annual treatment costs (after estimated manufacturer rebates) ranged enormously across biologics [(Egilman et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10882509/):

| Biologic | Brand Name | Annual US Net Cost (est. 2023) | PASI 90 Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infliximab biosimilar (infliximab-dyyb) | Inflectra | ~$1,664 | ~57% |
| Infliximab biosimilar (infliximab-abda) | Renflexis | Low (biosimilar) | ~57% |
| Adalimumab | Humira | Declining (biosimilar competition) | ~45% |
| Etanercept | Enbrel | Mid-range | ~17.9% |
| Brodalumab | Siliq | Mid-range | ~70% |
| Ustekinumab | Stelara | Mid-to-high | ~42% |
| Certolizumab pegol | Cimzia | Mid-to-high | ~36% |
| Tildrakizumab | Ilumya | Mid-to-high | ~55% |
| Secukinumab | Cosentyx | High | ~67% |
| Guselkumab | Tremfya | High | ~69% |
| Ixekizumab | Taltz | High | ~68% |
| Risankizumab | Skyrizi | ~$79,277 | ~71.6% |

The study found that US biologic prices were not well aligned with clinical benefit: prices would need to be reduced by a median of 71% to match the cost-effectiveness ratios seen in peer countries such as Australia, Canada, France, and Germany [(Egilman et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10882509/).

In the UK, biologics for psoriasis are available on the NHS but are subject to cost-effectiveness appraisal by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Patients typically must have failed conventional systemic therapies (such as methotrexate) before biologics are approved, and NICE has negotiated confidential patient access schemes with manufacturers to reduce costs. UK list prices differ significantly from US list prices but are typically in the range of several thousand pounds per dose for the newer IL-23 inhibitors.

By 2021, IL-23 inhibitors — particularly risankizumab (Skyrizi) — had become the most commonly initiated biologics for psoriasis, with 42% of newly treated patients starting on Skyrizi, and 21% starting on IL-17 inhibitors such as Taltz (ixekizumab) or Cosentyx (secukinumab) [(Rome et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40238112/).

### 9.4 Biosimilars

**Biosimilars** are biologic medicines that are "highly similar" to an already-approved reference biologic, with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, efficacy, or immunogenicity (the tendency of a drug to provoke an unwanted immune response against itself, which can reduce effectiveness or cause side effects). Unlike generic small-molecule drugs (which are chemically identical copies), biosimilars cannot be exact replicas of their reference product because biologics are produced in living cell systems, introducing inherent micro-variability. Biosimilars undergo a more rigorous approval process than traditional generics but fewer clinical trials than original biologics, since the mechanisms of action and dosing have already been established [(National Psoriasis Foundation, 2025)](https://www.psoriasis.org/biosimilars/).

Biosimilars offer the promise of significantly reduced treatment costs. For example, infliximab biosimilars reduced the annual cost of infliximab-based treatment from tens of thousands of dollars to approximately $1,664 per year [(Egilman et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10882509/).

As of early 2026, biosimilars are available or approved for the following psoriasis biologics:

**Infliximab (Remicade)** — The first psoriasis biologic to receive biosimilar competition. Multiple FDA-approved biosimilars are available in the US, including:
- **Inflectra** (infliximab-dyyb) — the first psoriasis biosimilar, FDA-approved April 2016
- **Renflexis** (infliximab-abda)
- **Avsola** (infliximab-axxq)

**Adalimumab (Humira)** — After Humira's patent exclusivity ended, numerous biosimilars launched in the US beginning in 2023. These have driven significant cost savings and formulary changes. Multiple biosimilars are now available, including Hadlima, Hyrimoz, Cyltezo (the first FDA-designated *interchangeable* adalimumab biosimilar), Amjevita, Yusimry, and others. Formularies that have excluded Humira in favour of its biosimilars have seen substantial savings [(Segal, 2025)](https://www.segalco.com/consulting-insights/q3-2025-trends-focus-specialty-dermatological-drugs).

**Ustekinumab (Stelara)** — Began facing biosimilar competition in January 2025. Several Stelara biosimilars have been approved by the FDA [(GoodRx, 2025)](https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/psoriasis/new-psoriasis-medications).

**Etanercept (Enbrel)** — Biosimilars have been approved in some markets, though US availability has been complicated by patent litigation.

**Biologics without biosimilars**: The newer IL-23 inhibitors (Skyrizi, Tremfya, Ilumya), IL-17 inhibitors (Cosentyx, Taltz, Siliq, Bimzelx), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), and spesolimab (Spevigo) are all still under patent protection and do not yet have biosimilar competition. However, a proposed secukinumab (Cosentyx) biosimilar — BAT2306 — is in development [(GoodRx, 2025)](https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/psoriasis/new-psoriasis-medications).

The availability of biosimilars is expected to expand significantly in the coming years as more patents expire, potentially transforming the economics of psoriasis treatment and broadening access to biologic therapy worldwide.

### 9.5 Small Molecule Inhibitors

- **Apremilast (Otezla)**: An oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor — PDE4 is an enzyme inside immune cells that normally breaks down a molecule called cAMP; by blocking PDE4, apremilast increases cAMP levels, which dampens the production of inflammatory cytokines. Less effective than biologics but offers an oral route of administration (a pill rather than an injection) with a favourable safety profile.
- **Deucravacitinib (Sotyktu)**: A selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor. TYK2 is a member of the JAK enzyme family that sits inside cells and relays signals from the IL-23, IL-12, and type I interferon receptors. By blocking TYK2, deucravacitinib interrupts these specific signalling pathways without broadly suppressing the immune system, offering a more targeted approach than older, non-selective JAK inhibitors [(PMC, 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10819460/).

### 9.6 Conventional Systemic Agents

- **Methotrexate**: A folic acid antagonist (it blocks the use of folic acid, a B vitamin needed for cell division) with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Widely used, inexpensive, and effective for both skin psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but requires monitoring for hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and myelosuppression (reduced bone marrow function, which can lower blood cell counts).
- **Cyclosporine**: A calcineurin inhibitor (it blocks calcineurin, a protein that T cells need to activate) that suppresses T cell activation. Effective but limited by nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) and is generally used for short-term control.
- **Acitretin**: An oral retinoid (a synthetic form of vitamin A). Teratogenic (causes birth defects), precluding use in women of childbearing potential.

### 9.7 Phototherapy

**Narrowband UV-B (NB-UVB)** phototherapy is the most commonly prescribed light therapy for psoriasis. UV-B radiation induces apoptosis (programmed cell death — a controlled self-destruct mechanism that cells use to die without causing inflammation) in activated T cells in the skin and suppresses local immune responses. **PUVA** (psoralen + UV-A) is also used but carries a higher long-term risk of skin cancer.

## 13. Landmark Studies of Recent Years (2023–2025)

The pace of psoriasis research has accelerated dramatically. This section highlights the most significant studies published in 2023–2025, explaining why each matters and what new knowledge it introduced.

### 12.1 The 109-Loci GWAS Meta-Analysis (Dand et al., 2025)

**Study:** *Identification of 109 psoriasis susceptibility loci, including 46 novel loci, by multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis.* Dand N, et al. Nature Communications. 2025;16:2267.
**Read it:** [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56719-8)

**Why it matters:** This is the largest genetic study of psoriasis ever conducted, analysing 36,466 psoriasis cases and 458,078 controls across 18 genome-wide association studies. It nearly doubled the number of known psoriasis risk loci from ~63 to 109, including 46 entirely novel genetic associations.

**New knowledge:** The study provided genetic proof that the IL-23/IL-17 axis is the central pathogenic pathway in psoriasis — not just a clinical observation, but confirmed at the level of DNA. It also revealed new pathway involvement, including type I interferon signalling, NF-κB regulation, and skin barrier function genes. Perhaps most importantly for patients, it validated the targets of existing biologic therapies at a genetic level, and provided a foundation for future pharmacogenomic approaches that could match patients to the right drug based on their individual genetic profile.

### 12.2 The STEPIn Trial — Early Intervention as Disease Modification (Iversen et al., 2023; Conrad et al., 2023)

**Study:** *Secukinumab demonstrates superiority over narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy in new-onset moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients: Week 52 results from the STEPIn study.* Iversen L, Conrad C, Eidsmo L, et al. JEADV. 2023;37(5):1004–1016.
**Read it:** [JEADV (Wiley)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18846)

**Why it matters:** STEPIn was the first clinical trial ever designed to test whether treating psoriasis aggressively and early — within the first year of disease onset — could modify the long-term course of the disease, rather than just managing symptoms. This is a paradigm shift: the question moved from "how do we control this disease?" to "can we prevent it from becoming chronic in the first place?"

**New knowledge:** At week 52, over 90% of patients treated with secukinumab (an IL-17A inhibitor) achieved PASI 90, dramatically outperforming phototherapy. Even more remarkably, epigenetic analysis of skin biopsies from STEPIn participants showed that patients treated within the first year of disease had their DNA methylation patterns (epigenetic "scarring" that locks cells into an inflammatory state) reversed to normal levels after 12 months of treatment. Patients who had the disease for more than 5 years before treatment still had residual epigenetic scarring even after therapy [(Conrad et al., 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02649-w). This suggests a "window of opportunity" in early psoriasis where aggressive treatment could potentially prevent permanent immune reprogramming of the skin.

The GUIDE trial is now investigating a similar approach using guselkumab (an IL-23 inhibitor) with treatment tapering.

### 12.3 The GUIDE Trial — Super-Responders and Treatment Tapering (Eyerich et al., 2024)

**Study:** *Early disease intervention with guselkumab in psoriasis leads to a higher rate of stable complete skin clearance ('clinical super response').* Eyerich K, et al. JAMA Dermatology. 2024;160(8):953–963.
**Read it:** [JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2820951)

**Why it matters:** The GUIDE trial introduced the concept of "clinical super-responders" — patients who achieve complete skin clearance that remains stable even when treatment is reduced or withdrawn. This addresses the critical question: can we eventually stop biologic therapy in some patients?

**New knowledge:** Interim results showed that patients with shorter disease duration (≤2 years) were significantly more likely to achieve and maintain complete skin clearance than patients with longer disease histories. This reinforces the STEPIn findings and supports the hypothesis that early, aggressive treatment may prevent the establishment of tissue-resident memory T cells and epigenetic changes that drive chronic, relapsing disease.

### 12.4 Bimekizumab Phase 3 Trials — Dual IL-17 Blockade (Warren et al., 2021–2023; BE VIVID, BE READY, BE RADIANT, BE BRIGHT)

**Study:** *Bimekizumab versus adalimumab in plaque psoriasis.* Warren RB, et al. N Engl J Med. 2021;385(2):130–141 (BE VIVID). Extended data published through 2023.
**Read it:** [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102388)

**Why it matters:** Bimekizumab was the first biologic to simultaneously block both IL-17A and IL-17F, testing the hypothesis that IL-17F — previously considered less important than IL-17A — also contributes meaningfully to psoriatic inflammation.

**New knowledge:** The BE VIVID and BE READY trials demonstrated that dual IL-17A/F blockade produces among the highest rates of complete skin clearance (PASI 100) of any therapy studied to date, with responses maintained through 3 years in the BE BRIGHT extension study [(Strober et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/). Bimekizumab was FDA-approved in October 2023. Its success confirmed that IL-17F is indeed a non-redundant driver of psoriatic inflammation and that blocking both IL-17 family members provides additional clinical benefit over blocking IL-17A alone.

### 12.5 Cochrane Network Meta-Analysis of Systemic Therapies (Sbidian et al., 2023)

**Study:** *Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis.* Sbidian E, Chaimani A, et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2023;7:CD011535.
**Read it:** [Cochrane Library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011535.pub6/full)

**Why it matters:** This is the gold standard of evidence synthesis — a Cochrane network meta-analysis — and provides the most comprehensive comparison of all systemic psoriasis therapies ever conducted. It is the reference that clinical guidelines worldwide rely on when ranking treatment options.

**New knowledge:** The analysis definitively established the efficacy hierarchy of psoriasis biologics. IL-23 inhibitors (risankizumab, guselkumab) and the dual IL-17 inhibitor bimekizumab ranked at the top for achieving PASI 90. It confirmed that the newer biologics targeting IL-23 and IL-17 are substantially more effective than older TNF-α inhibitors and conventional systemics, while maintaining favourable safety profiles. This evidence has driven the global shift toward IL-23 inhibitors as first-line biologic therapy.

### 12.6 Oral IL-23 Receptor Antagonist — Icotrokinra Phase 3 (ICONIC-LEAD, 2025)

**Study:** *Icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) Phase 3 ICONIC-LEAD trial results.* Presented at AAD Annual Meeting, March 2025.
**Read it:** [Johnson & Johnson press release](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/icotrokinra-results-show-potential-to-set-a-new-standard-of-treatment-in-plaque-psoriasis)

**Why it matters:** Icotrokinra is a first-in-class oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor. If approved, it would be the first pill to offer the efficacy profile of an injectable IL-23 inhibitor — potentially eliminating the need for injections entirely for many patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

**New knowledge:** Phase 3 data showed that nearly half of patients achieved completely clear skin (IGA 0) at week 24 with a once-daily pill. Johnson & Johnson has initiated the first-ever head-to-head trial comparing an oral drug (icotrokinra) against an injectable biologic (ustekinumab), seeking to prove that a pill can match or surpass a biologic injection. This could fundamentally shift how psoriasis is treated, removing a major barrier (injection aversion) that prevents some patients from starting biologic therapy.

### 12.7 Zasocitinib Phase 3 — Next-Generation Oral TYK2 Inhibitor (Takeda, December 2025)

**Study:** *Phase 3 pivotal studies of zasocitinib (TAK-279) in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.* Topline results announced December 2025.
**Read it:** [Takeda press release](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2025/takeda-zasocitinib-phase-3-plaque-psoriasis-data-once-daily-pill/)

**Why it matters:** Zasocitinib is a next-generation TYK2 inhibitor that is more selective and potent than the first-in-class deucravacitinib (Sotyktu). The Phase 3 results test whether a second-generation oral TYK2 inhibitor can close the efficacy gap between pills and injectable biologics.

**New knowledge:** Both pivotal studies met all primary and all 44 ranked secondary endpoints, including PASI 90 and PASI 100, demonstrating complete skin clearance with a once-daily pill — results that approach injectable biologic-level efficacy. This confirmed that the TYK2 pathway, once considered "undruggable," can be effectively targeted orally, opening the door to an era where high-efficacy psoriasis treatment may no longer require injections.

### 12.8 Biologics Reduce Psoriatic Arthritis Development (Floris et al., 2025)

**Study:** *Treatment of psoriasis with different classes of biologics reduces the likelihood of peripheral and axial psoriatic arthritis development.* Floris A, et al. Rheumatology. 2025;64:1131–1137.
**Read it:** [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/64/3/1131/7691289)

**Why it matters:** Approximately 30% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), often years after skin disease onset. This study is among the first to demonstrate that treating psoriasis with biologics doesn't just clear skin — it may actually prevent the development of joint disease.

**New knowledge:** The study found that patients treated with IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors had a significantly reduced likelihood of developing both peripheral and axial psoriatic arthritis compared to untreated patients or those on conventional therapies. This finding supports the "psoriatic march" hypothesis (Section 11.7) and has major clinical implications: it suggests that early, effective biologic treatment of skin psoriasis may prevent the downstream organ damage that occurs when systemic inflammation is left unchecked.

### 12.9 Hepcidin and Iron Dysregulation — A Novel Pathogenic Mechanism (2024)

**Study:** Reported by ScienceDaily, September 2024.
**Read it:** [ScienceDaily summary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/health_medicine/psoriasis/)

**Why it matters:** Researchers have proposed that hepcidin — a hormone that regulates iron metabolism — when produced abnormally in the skin, may be a root cause of psoriatic inflammation. This is a completely novel angle that falls outside the traditional IL-23/IL-17 paradigm.

**New knowledge:** If confirmed in larger studies, iron dysregulation in the skin could represent an entirely new therapeutic target. This finding reminds us that while the IL-23/Th17 axis is the dominant framework, psoriasis pathogenesis may involve additional mechanisms that current therapies do not address.

### 12.10 Somatic Mutations Ruled Out (2023)

**Study:** *Psoriasis not caused by spontaneous mutations in skin cells.* Published October 2023.
**Read it:** [ScienceDaily summary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/10/231026121930.htm)

**Why it matters:** One longstanding hypothesis was that psoriasis might be driven by somatic mutations (random DNA changes that accumulate in skin cells over a person's lifetime), similar to how cancer develops. If true, this would have fundamentally changed how we understand the disease.

**New knowledge:** Comprehensive genetic analysis showed that somatic mutations are not linked to either the development or the spread of psoriatic plaques. This conclusively rules out a cancer-like mutational model and confirms that psoriasis is driven by immune dysregulation acting on genetically predisposed but otherwise normal skin cells — reinforcing the rationale for immune-targeting therapies.

## 14. Emerging Research and Future Directions

### 10.1 Oral IL-23 Pathway Inhibitors

A major area of development is the creation of orally administered IL-23 pathway inhibitors. **JNJ-77242113** (now known as icotrokinra) is an investigational oral peptide that antagonises the IL-23 receptor, potentially combining the high efficacy of IL-23 inhibition with the convenience of oral dosing [(PMC, 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/).

### 10.2 Targeting Immunological Memory

Given the role of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) in psoriasis relapse, there is significant interest in developing therapies that target these memory populations. Successfully depleting or reprogramming TRM cells could theoretically achieve true disease modification rather than merely suppressing active inflammation [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/).

### 10.3 The Microbiome as a Therapeutic Target

Research into the gut-skin axis may yield new therapeutic approaches. Prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation are being investigated for their potential to modulate systemic inflammation in psoriasis. Dietary interventions — particularly Mediterranean, low-calorie, and omega-3-enriched diets — have shown some benefit as adjunctive strategies [(Caso et al., 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541512/).

### 10.4 Personalised/Precision Medicine

The integration of genetic data (such as HLA-C*06:02 status), transcriptomic profiling of lesional skin, and biomarker-guided treatment selection represents the direction of precision medicine in psoriasis. As genetic risk scores become more refined, they may enable risk prediction for disease onset, disease severity, comorbidity development, and treatment response [(Li et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/pcm/article/2/2/120/5522496).

### 15.2 Patient-Oriented and Alternative Approach Books

---

**Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative**
*Author: John O.A. Pagano D.C.*
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, 2009 (revised edition) | ISBN: 978-0-470-26726-3

The best-known patient-oriented book on psoriasis, originally published in 1991 and now in a revised edition. Pagano's central thesis is that psoriasis originates in the intestines ("leaky gut") and can be managed through dietary modification, detoxification, and spinal adjustments. The book outlines an elimination diet, herbal teas, and lifestyle changes. It remains hugely popular with patients, with a companion cookbook also available (*Dr. John's Healing Psoriasis Cookbook*).

**About the author:** John O.A. Pagano (1929–2012) was a chiropractic physician based in New Jersey who spent over 40 years developing his dietary approach to psoriasis. His work is not considered evidence-based by mainstream dermatology, and his "leaky gut" hypothesis, while now partially supported by emerging microbiome research (Section 7.5), has never been validated in controlled clinical trials. Nevertheless, many patients report subjective benefit from his dietary recommendations, and the book has been translated into multiple languages.

**⚠ Note:** This book should be read critically. While some dietary principles overlap with evidence-supported recommendations (reducing processed food, increasing fibre), other claims lack scientific support, and the book should not be used as a substitute for medical treatment.

---

**The Psoriasis Cure: A Drug-Free Guide to Stopping and Reversing the Symptoms of Psoriasis**
*Author: Lisa LeVan*
Publisher: Avery, 2000 | ISBN: 978-0-89529-983-5

A patient guide emphasising dietary and lifestyle interventions, nutritional supplementation, and stress management. Covers fish oil, antioxidant vitamins, herbal remedies, and elimination diets. Written in accessible language for newly diagnosed patients.

**About the author:** Lisa LeVan is a health writer and patient advocate who was diagnosed with psoriasis herself. The book reflects the patient experience but, like the Pagano book, its dietary and supplement recommendations are not supported by robust clinical trial evidence. It should be read as a patient perspective rather than a clinical guide.

**⚠ Note:** The title's promise of a "cure" is misleading — there is no cure for psoriasis. Some dietary recommendations overlap with emerging evidence (omega-3 fatty acids, anti-inflammatory diets) but others are unsubstantiated.

---

**Psoriasis: Causes, Diagnosis and Therapies**
*Editor: Emily Howling*
Publisher: Foster Academics, 2016 | ISBN: 978-1-63241-435-9

An edited academic volume covering research on psoriasis causes, diagnosis, and treatment. Discusses both established knowledge and recent research directions in immunology and genetics. Aimed at students and professionals in dermatology and medical genetics.

---

### 15.3 General Dermatology References with Major Psoriasis Coverage

---

*Editors: Christopher E.M. Griffiths, Jonathan Barker, Tanya Bleiker, Robert Chalmers, Daniel Creamer*
Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell, 2016 | ISBN: 978-1-118-44117-6

The gold-standard general dermatology textbook, with a comprehensive multi-chapter section on psoriasis covering epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment. Chapter 20 (Psoriasis) by Griffiths and Barker is one of the most authoritative single-chapter reviews of the disease available. Essential reference for any dermatology trainee.

**About the editors:** The same Griffiths and Barker team that edited the *Textbook of Psoriasis* (above), ensuring the psoriasis content reflects the leading expertise in the field.

---

**Treatment of Skin Disease: Comprehensive Therapeutic Strategies (6th Edition)**
*Editors: Mark G. Lebwohl, Warren R. Heymann, Ian Coulson, John Berth-Jones*
Publisher: Elsevier, 2022 | ISBN: 978-0-7020-8221-5

A practical treatment-focused reference covering over 270 dermatological conditions. The psoriasis sections provide evidence-ranked therapeutic algorithms (first-line, second-line, third-line) for each clinical subtype, including plaque, guttate, pustular, inverse, nail, and erythrodermic psoriasis. Invaluable for clinical decision-making.

**About the editors:** Mark Lebwohl (see above) and Warren Heymann are both internationally recognised for psoriasis expertise. The multi-edition success of this book reflects its practical utility in daily clinical practice.

---

**Fitzpatrick's Dermatology (9th Edition, 2 Volumes)**
*Editors: Sewon Kang, Masayuki Amagai, Anna L. Bruckner, Alexander H. Enk, David J. Margolis, Amy J. McMichael, Jeffrey S. Orringer*
Publisher: McGraw-Hill, 2019 | ISBN: 978-0-07-183778-1

The most comprehensive general dermatology reference in the English language (over 3,500 pages across two volumes). Contains extensive multi-chapter coverage of psoriasis including pathophysiology, clinical variants, comorbidities, and the full therapeutic spectrum from topicals to biologics. A cornerstone reference for any academic dermatology department.

**About the work:** Originally created by Thomas B. Fitzpatrick, the founder of modern academic dermatology at Harvard, and now in its 9th edition with editors from leading institutions worldwide.

---

> **Note for future review:** The clinical textbooks (Griffiths/Barker, Lebwohl/Koo, Menter/Ryan, Bhutani) contain the most reliable and up-to-date scientific information. The patient-oriented books (Pagano, LeVan) are popular but should be evaluated critically against the evidence presented in this paper, particularly Sections 9 (Lifestyle and Diet) and 7 (Immunopathogenesis). Several of these books — particularly the older editions — predate the biologic therapy revolution and the IL-23/Th17 paradigm shift; readers should supplement them with recent primary literature.

## 16. A History of Psoriasis: From Stigma to Science

### 16.1 Ancient and Biblical Origins

Psoriasis is one of the oldest recognised skin diseases, but for most of recorded history it was not distinguished from other scaly or disfiguring conditions — most notably leprosy (Hansen's disease). The Hebrew Bible describes a condition called *tzaraat* (צָרַעַת), which caused people to be declared ritually unclean and banished from their communities (Leviticus 13–14). Scholars now believe that many cases of *tzaraat* were likely psoriasis rather than true leprosy, meaning people with psoriasis may have been among the first patients subjected to medical exile. The stigma was profound: affected individuals were forced to live outside the camp, wear torn clothes, and cry "unclean, unclean" to warn others.

Ancient Egyptian medical texts (the Ebers Papyrus, c. 1550 BC) describe treatments for scaly skin conditions using mixtures including cat faeces, which represents one of the earliest recorded topical therapies. Hippocrates (460–377 BC) used the Greek term *lopoi* (scaly conditions) to describe what may have included psoriasis, and was the first physician to advocate coal tar treatment to increase skin sensitivity to sunlight — a principle that would eventually evolve into modern phototherapy thousands of years later. Galen (133–200 AD) used the term *psoriasis* — derived from the Greek *psora* (to itch) — but confusingly applied it to a condition of the eyelids and scrotum that was likely seborrhoeic dermatitis rather than what we now call psoriasis.

### 16.2 The Leprosy Confusion (200 AD – 1800)

For over 1,500 years following Galen, psoriasis and leprosy remained entangled in medical and public consciousness. During medieval Europe, both conditions were grouped under the Latin term *lepra*, and people with either disease were subjected to similar social exclusion, forced into leprosariums, and sometimes required to carry a bell or clapper to announce their presence. This confusion persisted even as knowledge of other diseases advanced. Treatments during this era were rudimentary and often dangerous: mercury ointments, arsenic compounds, viper broth, bloodletting, and purgatives were all applied without clear distinction between conditions.

### 16.3 The Birth of Dermatology (1800–1900)

The separation of psoriasis from leprosy is one of the great diagnostic achievements of 19th-century medicine. In 1809, English physician Robert Willan (1757–1812) — widely regarded as the founder of dermatology as a medical speciality — published the first systematic classification of skin diseases in his work *On Cutaneous Diseases*. He provided the first clear clinical description of psoriasis, identifying guttate, scalp, and palmar variants, and noted that lesions typically begin on the elbows and knees. However, he used the term *lepra vulgaris*, unfortunately perpetuating the association with leprosy.

The decisive break came from Austrian dermatologist Ferdinand von Hebra (1816–1880), who in 1841 formally separated psoriasis from leprosy by eliminating the term *lepra* from descriptions of psoriatic lesions and restoring the name *psoriasis*. Von Hebra's work, including his landmark *Atlas der Hautkrankeiten* (Atlas of Skin Diseases), used clinical observation and early microscopy to establish psoriasis as a distinct entity.

Other 19th-century milestones followed: in 1860, Ernest Bazin connected psoriasis to joint disease ("arthritic psoriasis"), foreshadowing the modern understanding of psoriatic arthritis. In 1872, Heinrich Köbner described the phenomenon of new psoriatic lesions appearing at sites of skin trauma — now known as the Köbner phenomenon and still used as a diagnostic indicator. In 1879, Heinrich Auspitz described the pinpoint bleeding when psoriatic scale is removed (the Auspitz sign). And in the 1890s, William Munro described the characteristic neutrophil micro-abscesses in the epidermis that pathologists still look for today.

### 16.4 The Twentieth Century: From Skin Disease to Immune Disease

The 20th century saw two transformative shifts in understanding. The first was therapeutic: Goeckerman introduced his combination of coal tar and ultraviolet light therapy in 1925, and Ingram added anthralin application to this regimen in 1953 — these approaches remained mainstays of treatment for decades. Methotrexate, originally developed as a cancer chemotherapy agent, was discovered to improve psoriasis in the 1950s when patients receiving it for other conditions saw their skin clear. It received formal indication for psoriasis in 1972 and remains widely used today.

The second shift was conceptual. Throughout the early 20th century, psoriasis was understood as a disorder of keratinocyte hyperproliferation — the skin cells were simply growing too fast. The immune system was not considered central. This changed dramatically in the 1970s–1990s through several serendipitous observations. The discovery that cyclosporine — an immunosuppressant drug developed for organ transplant patients — potently cleared psoriasis was pivotal. If suppressing the immune system cured the skin disease, then the immune system must be driving it. This was confirmed by studies showing that bone marrow transplant from a psoriasis patient to a non-psoriatic recipient could transfer the disease, and conversely, transplant from a non-psoriatic donor to a psoriasis patient could cure it.

### 16.5 The Biologic Revolution (2003–Present)

The identification of TNF-α as a key cytokine in psoriasis led to the first biologic therapy approvals: etanercept (2004) and adalimumab (2008) for psoriasis, following earlier success in rheumatoid arthritis. For the first time, some patients experienced complete skin clearance. The subsequent discovery of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the mid-2000s refined understanding further and led to a succession of increasingly targeted and effective drugs: ustekinumab (2009, targeting IL-12/23), secukinumab (2015, targeting IL-17A), and risankizumab (2019, targeting IL-23 specifically). Each generation has improved efficacy, with modern IL-23 inhibitors achieving PASI 100 (complete clearance) in 40–55% of patients — a result that would have seemed miraculous to earlier generations of dermatologists.

The journey from biblical exile to molecular medicine spans over 3,000 years. It is a story of incremental observation punctuated by revolutionary insights — and a reminder that the stigma associated with visible skin disease has a very long shadow.

## 17. Psoriasis in Special Populations

The experience of psoriasis differs significantly across certain population groups — in how the disease presents, how it is diagnosed, and which treatments are safe and appropriate. This section addresses three populations where these differences have important clinical and practical implications: pregnancy, children, and people with skin of colour.

### 17.1 Pregnancy and Conception

Pregnancy and psoriasis present a complex intersection, particularly relevant for patients who are trying to conceive or are already pregnant. The challenges are threefold: the natural course of psoriasis changes during pregnancy; many standard treatments are unsafe for the developing foetus; and the evidence base for drug safety in pregnancy is limited because pregnant women are routinely excluded from clinical trials.

**Natural course during pregnancy.** Approximately 40–60% of women with psoriasis experience improvement during pregnancy, likely due to the shift from Th1/Th17-dominant immunity towards a Th2-dominant profile that occurs naturally to protect the foetus from the mother's immune system. However, roughly 10–20% of women experience worsening, and postpartum flares within the first few months after delivery are common.

**Treatments to avoid absolutely.** Two commonly used psoriasis drugs are known teratogens (substances that cause birth defects) and are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy and conception:

- **Methotrexate** is highly teratogenic, associated with pregnancy loss and congenital anomalies including microcephaly, craniosynostosis, limb defects, and tetralogy of Fallot. It must be stopped at least 3 months before conception in women and at least 3 months in men (the BAD recommends the same washout for male patients, though evidence for male teratogenicity is less established).
- **Acitretin** (a retinoid) has an extremely prolonged elimination half-life and requires reliable contraception for 3 years after stopping treatment. Topical tazarotene (another retinoid) is also contraindicated.

**Safe topical options.** Emollients, low-to-moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) are considered safe during pregnancy when used appropriately and not applied to the nipple area during breastfeeding. Narrowband UVB phototherapy is safe throughout pregnancy and is often the first-line choice for moderate disease.

**Biologics during pregnancy.** The landscape is evolving rapidly, with increasing evidence that biologics — previously avoided in pregnancy due to lack of data — may be safer than previously assumed:

- **Certolizumab pegol** is the preferred biologic during pregnancy. Unlike all other biologics, it lacks the Fc region (the part of the antibody that is actively transported across the placenta), so it does not cross the placenta in significant amounts. The landmark CRIB study confirmed negligible foetal exposure. Certolizumab is also minimally excreted in breast milk, making it safe during breastfeeding without modification of the infant vaccination schedule.
- **Other TNF inhibitors** (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) can be used during the first half of pregnancy. However, because they are IgG1 antibodies with Fc regions, they are actively transferred across the placenta during the second and third trimesters. If used beyond week 20, live vaccines (such as BCG and rotavirus) should be delayed in the infant until 6 months of age.
- **IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors**: Data are more limited. A 2025 WHO pharmacovigilance analysis of over 140 million reports found that most biologics (including secukinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab, and tildrakizumab) had lower frequencies of pregnancy-related adverse outcomes compared to TNF inhibitors. However, risankizumab showed a signal for increased abortion and stillbirth risk (ROR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32–2.63), requiring further investigation. Current consensus recommends discontinuing IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors when pregnancy is confirmed unless no safer alternative exists.

**Guidance for patients trying to conceive.** Current BAD and European guidelines recommend: (1) plan the pregnancy during a period of disease stability; (2) if systemic treatment is needed during pregnancy, certolizumab pegol is first-line; (3) NB-UVB phototherapy is a safe non-drug option; (4) methotrexate and acitretin must be stopped well in advance; (5) cyclosporine can be used short-term in pregnancy if needed (it does not appear to be teratogenic, though it crosses the placenta).

### 17.2 Paediatric Psoriasis

Psoriasis begins in childhood in approximately one-third of all cases, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5–2% in children. It can present at any age, including infancy, though onset is more common during adolescence. Female children are affected slightly more frequently than males.

**Differences in presentation.** While children can develop any subtype of psoriasis, certain presentations are more common or appear differently than in adults:

- **Napkin psoriasis** (nappy-area psoriasis) can be the earliest manifestation, presenting as persistent, well-demarcated erythema in the nappy area of infants. It is often mistaken for nappy rash and may not develop classic silvery scale.
- **Facial involvement** is more common in children than adults (up to 50% of paediatric cases), as are involvement of the scalp and flexural areas.
- **Guttate psoriasis** is particularly common in children and is frequently triggered by streptococcal pharyngitis.
- **Thinner plaques** and finer scale are typical in younger children. Classic adult-pattern thick plaques develop more commonly in adolescence.

**Psychological impact.** The psychological burden of psoriasis in children should not be underestimated. Visible skin disease during formative years affects self-esteem, body image, peer relationships, and school attendance. Bullying and social isolation are frequently reported. Parents also experience significant psychological distress, including guilt and helplessness.

**Comorbidities start early.** Children with psoriasis already show increased rates of obesity (approximately double that of unaffected children), with central obesity developing around age 8. Metabolic screening is increasingly recommended in paediatric guidelines.

**Treatment.** Most paediatric psoriasis is mild and manageable with topical therapy: low-potency corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol), calcineurin inhibitors for face and flexures, and emollients. NB-UVB phototherapy is safe in children. For moderate-to-severe disease, systemic options have expanded considerably in recent years. Biologics now approved for paediatric psoriasis (ages vary by drug and country) include etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab. Apremilast was approved for children aged 6–17 in August 2024 (USA). Roflumilast cream (a topical PDE4 inhibitor) was also approved for children aged 6 and over in 2024.

### 17.3 Psoriasis in Skin of Colour

Psoriasis affects all racial and ethnic groups, but there are significant differences in prevalence, clinical presentation, diagnostic accuracy, treatment access, and outcomes. These disparities represent one of the most important equity issues in dermatology today.

**Prevalence.** While psoriasis prevalence is highest in white populations (approximately 3.6% in the US), it also affects Asian (2.5%), Hispanic (1.9%), and Black (1.5%) populations at substantial rates. These lower rates may partly reflect underdiagnosis rather than true lower prevalence.

**Clinical presentation differs.** The classic teaching of psoriasis — red, well-demarcated, silvery-scaled plaques — describes the disease primarily as it appears on lighter skin. On darker skin tones, erythema (redness) may be far less visible or absent entirely. Instead, plaques may appear violaceous (purple), grey, dark brown, or hyperpigmented. Scale may appear grey rather than silvery. These differences mean that clinicians trained primarily on light-skin presentations may miss or misdiagnose psoriasis in patients with darker skin.

**Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)** — persistent dark discolouration at sites where plaques have healed — is a significant additional burden in skin of colour that is largely absent in lighter skin. PIH can persist for months to years after active disease has resolved and is often more distressing to patients than the plaques themselves.

**Diagnostic delays and disparities.** Research consistently demonstrates that racial and ethnic minority patients wait significantly longer for diagnosis — approximately 3 times longer than white patients — and are 3 times more likely to require a skin biopsy to confirm diagnosis (rather than receiving a clinical diagnosis). A 2024 NPF Health Indicator Report found that racial and ethnic minority individuals are 112% more likely to live with undiagnosed psoriasis. Only 10.3% of images in dermatology textbooks show dark skin, contributing to a training gap that perpetuates diagnostic difficulty.

**Treatment disparities.** Even after diagnosis, disparities persist. Black Medicare recipients in the US are 70% less likely to receive biologic therapy for severe psoriasis than white patients. Hospitalisation rates for psoriasis are significantly higher among Black (OR 1.28), Hispanic (OR 1.65), and Asian (OR 2.08) individuals compared to white individuals. Quality of life scores (DLQI) are consistently worse among Black (8.3), Hispanic (8.0), and Asian (7.9) patients compared to white patients (5.6) in the PSOLAR registry.

**Research gaps.** Clinical trials for new psoriasis medications have historically had very low representation of non-white participants, limiting knowledge of how treatments perform across diverse populations. The VISIBLE study (NCT05272150), initiated in 2022, was specifically designed to assess guselkumab in patients with skin of colour and represents a growing recognition of this evidence gap. HLA-C*06:02 positivity — the strongest genetic risk factor — is generally higher in white populations than in Asian populations, and few genome-wide association studies have focused on African ancestry, highlighting a critical genetic research gap.

## 18. The Psychological and Social Burden of Psoriasis

Psoriasis exerts a psychological toll that is frequently disproportionate to the physical severity of the disease. A patient with limited disease on the hands, face, or genitals may experience greater psychological distress than a patient with extensive disease on the trunk and limbs. Understanding the mental health dimensions of psoriasis is essential for holistic care.

### 18.1 Depression

Depression is the most-studied psychiatric comorbidity in psoriasis. A landmark UK population-based cohort study (n = 146,042 psoriasis patients vs. 766,950 controls) found adjusted hazard ratios for depression of 1.39 overall (95% CI 1.37–1.41), rising to 1.72 for severe psoriasis (95% CI 1.57–1.88). The authors estimated that, in the UK alone, over 10,400 diagnoses of depression per year are attributable to psoriasis. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among psoriasis patients may reach 62% in some studies, with 14.9% meeting clinical diagnostic thresholds. Depression is more prevalent among women with psoriasis and among those with more severe disease, psoriatic arthritis, or multiple comorbidities.

The relationship is likely bidirectional: psoriasis causes depression through psychological and social mechanisms (stigma, shame, restricted activities, relationship difficulties, reduced employment), but depression may also worsen psoriasis through biological pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines elevated in psoriasis — including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-17 — are also elevated in major depressive disorder, suggesting shared inflammatory mechanisms. Biologic therapies such as anti-IL-17A antibodies have been shown to produce both depression remission and reduction in serum CRP in patients with comorbid psoriasis and depression, supporting a neuroinflammatory link.

### 18.2 Suicidal Ideation and Suicide

The relationship between psoriasis and suicidality has been examined in multiple systematic reviews with somewhat conflicting results. The UK cohort study above found an adjusted hazard ratio for suicidality of 1.44 (95% CI 1.32–1.57). A well-controlled pan-European study of 626 adult patients reported a 2.5-fold greater risk of suicidal ideation compared to controls. Among tertiary patients with moderate-to-severe disease, up to 47% report lifetime suicidal thoughts.

The 2025 BADBIR analysis (British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register) specifically examined suicide risk in patients with clinically confirmed moderate-to-severe psoriasis. It found that patients with a history of psychiatric comorbidity had significantly increased rates of all suicidality outcomes. However, the overall suicide rate among psoriasis patients was not significantly elevated compared to the general population. The authors emphasised the high prevalence of undiagnosed depression and the need for routine mental health assessment at every dermatology appointment.

### 18.3 Stigma, Shame, and Social Isolation

Unlike many chronic diseases, psoriasis is visible. Patients report being stared at, refused service at hairdressers and swimming pools, asked whether their condition is contagious, and experiencing rejection in intimate relationships. A concept termed "social skin" has been used in the dermatology literature to describe how the skin mediates social identity and interpersonal connection, and how visible skin disease disrupts this.

The WHO's 2016 Global Report on Psoriasis highlighted that patients frequently feel humiliated, stigmatised, and socially excluded, and called on governments to recognise psoriasis as a serious non-communicable disease. The report noted that patients with psoriasis often change their behaviour to avoid situations where their skin might be visible: avoiding swimming, changing how they dress, declining social invitations, and withdrawing from sexual relationships.

### 18.4 Impact on Employment and Productivity

Psoriasis significantly affects working life. Studies have documented increased absenteeism, presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), and career limitation. Patients with psoriasis affecting the hands face particular occupational challenges, as do those in public-facing roles where visible skin disease attracts attention or concern from colleagues and customers.

### 18.5 Psychological Interventions

Growing evidence supports incorporating psychological support into psoriasis care. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction, and habit reversal training (for itch-scratch cycles) have all shown benefit in small trials. Current guidelines increasingly advocate routine mental health screening — using validated tools such as the PHQ-2 or PHQ-9 for depression and asking about suicidal ideation — at every dermatology appointment, particularly when starting, changing, or reviewing systemic treatment.

## 19. The NHS Treatment Pathway (UK-Specific)

This section maps the typical journey of a psoriasis patient through the UK National Health Service, from first presentation to biologic therapy. Understanding this pathway is important for UK patients navigating the system and for understanding how NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidance shapes treatment access.

### 19.1 Primary Care (GP)

Most patients first present to their GP. Mild psoriasis (BSA < 10%) is managed entirely in primary care with topical therapies: emollients, topical corticosteroids (ranging from mild to potent depending on body site), vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol, calcitriol), and coal tar preparations. The GP will typically start with an emollient plus a moderate-potency steroid, stepping up as needed.

**Referral criteria.** NICE Clinical Guideline 153 recommends referral to a dermatologist when: the diagnosis is uncertain; the disease is moderate-to-severe or affecting high-impact sites (face, hands, feet, genitals, scalp); topical therapy has failed after an adequate trial; there is significant impact on quality of life (DLQI ≥ 10); psoriatic arthritis is suspected; or the patient is a child with widespread or treatment-resistant disease.

### 19.2 Secondary Care (Hospital Dermatology)

On referral, a consultant dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis, assess severity using PASI and DLQI scores, screen for comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, depression), and commence a treatment plan.

**Step 1: Optimised topical therapy.** The dermatologist may optimise topical treatment with combination products (calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate), stronger corticosteroids, or dithranol (anthralin).

**Step 2: Phototherapy.** NB-UVB phototherapy is the next step. It typically involves attending hospital 2–3 times per week for 8–12 weeks. PUVA (psoralen + UVA light) is used less commonly due to long-term skin cancer risk.

**Step 3: Conventional systemics.** If phototherapy is impractical, insufficient, or not tolerated, conventional systemic therapy is initiated. The standard first-line systemic is **methotrexate** (typically 15–25 mg once weekly with folic acid supplementation). Alternatives include **ciclosporin** (particularly for rapid control or in women of childbearing age), **acitretin** (particularly for palmoplantar or pustular disease), and **dimethyl fumarate**. These are monitored with regular blood tests (FBC, LFTs, renal function).

### 19.3 Biologic Eligibility

Biologic therapy is funded by the NHS under NICE Technology Appraisal guidance. The standard eligibility criteria are:

- **PASI ≥ 10** AND **DLQI ≥ 10** (i.e., at least moderate-to-severe disease with significant quality-of-life impact)
- The patient has **failed, is intolerant of, or has contraindications to at least two standard systemic therapies** (typically methotrexate and ciclosporin), or has failed one systemic therapy plus phototherapy

For **high-impact site psoriasis** (severe disease at localised sites causing significant functional impairment or distress — e.g., palmoplantar, genital, facial, or nail disease), the PASI criterion may not be applicable. BAD guidelines define this as a distinct pathway with local commissioning arrangements, typically requiring a PGA of moderate-to-severe and DLQI ≥ 10.

### 19.4 Choosing a Biologic

Once eligible, the choice of biologic follows both clinical and cost-effectiveness considerations. As of 2024–2025, the NHS treatment algorithm is broadly:

**First-line biologic:** Adalimumab biosimilar is currently the best-value biologic (BVB) in most NHS regions due to biosimilar competition driving costs down. However, clinical factors may direct the choice elsewhere — certolizumab for pregnancy planning, IL-17 inhibitors for coexisting psoriatic arthritis with axial disease, etc.

**Assessment of response.** Treatment response is measured at 16 weeks. NICE defines an adequate response as PASI 75 (75% improvement) or a PASI reduction of ≥ 50% plus a DLQI reduction of ≥ 5 points. If the patient does not meet this threshold, the biologic is stopped and the patient is switched.

**Switching.** Most NHS regions fund up to 3 sequential biologics, with a fourth permitted if the switch involves changing mechanism of action (e.g., moving from a TNF inhibitor to an IL-23 inhibitor). Patients do not need to "deteriorate back" to a PASI of 10 to be eligible for switching if they are demonstrably failing current therapy.

**NICE-approved biologics for plaque psoriasis** (as of early 2026) include: adalimumab (TA146), etanercept (TA103), infliximab (TA134), ustekinumab (TA180), secukinumab (TA350), ixekizumab (TA442), brodalumab (TA511), guselkumab (TA521), tildrakizumab (TA575), risankizumab (TA596), bimekizumab (TA723), certolizumab pegol, and the oral small molecules apremilast (TA419), dimethyl fumarate (TA475), and deucravacitinib (TA907).

### 19.5 Ongoing Monitoring

All patients on biologic therapy are enrolled in BADBIR (British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register), a national prospective registry that tracks long-term safety outcomes. Patients are typically reviewed every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months thereafter if stable, with blood monitoring as required by the specific drug.

## 20. Practical Daily Management: Living with Psoriasis

Clinical papers rarely address the everyday practicalities of living with psoriasis. This section covers the practical knowledge that patients commonly seek.

### 20.1 Skin Care Routine

**Moisturising** is the single most important daily intervention. Generous and frequent application of an emollient — ideally within 3 minutes of bathing while the skin is still damp — helps seal in moisture, reduce scale, and maintain the skin barrier. Ointment-based (greasy) emollients are most effective but can be cosmetically unacceptable during the day; cream-based emollients offer a reasonable daytime compromise. Common effective emollients available in the UK include Cetraben, Epaderm, Hydromol, and Diprobase. Avoid products with fragrances, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), or alcohol, which can irritate psoriatic skin.

**Bathing.** Lukewarm (not hot) baths or showers are preferred; hot water strips natural oils from the skin and can trigger flares. Bath additives such as colloidal oatmeal or emollient bath oils can soothe skin. Limit bath time to 10–15 minutes. Gently pat (don't rub) skin dry. Some patients find Dead Sea salt baths helpful, though clinical evidence is limited.

**Scale removal.** For thick plaques, gentle scale removal before applying topical treatments improves drug penetration. Salicylic acid preparations (2–10%) soften scale. Coconut oil applied under an occlusive wrap (cling film) overnight is a common home remedy for stubborn plaques. Never pick or scratch at scales — this risks triggering the Köbner phenomenon and worsening disease.

### 20.2 Scalp Care

Scalp psoriasis is one of the most common and difficult-to-treat sites. A practical approach: (1) apply a descaling preparation (coconut oil, salicylic acid, or a dedicated scalp oil) before washing; leave for at least 30 minutes to soften scale; (2) use a medicated shampoo (coal tar-based such as Polytar or T/Gel, or ketoconazole-based) 2–3 times per week, leaving it on the scalp for 5 minutes before rinsing; (3) apply prescribed topical treatment (calcipotriol scalp solution, steroid scalp application) to clean, de-scaled scalp for better absorption. Avoid aggressive brushing or scratching.

### 20.3 Nail Care

Nail psoriasis is slow to respond to treatment because nails grow slowly (fingernails: 3–4 mm/month, toenails: 1 mm/month). Keep nails trimmed short and filed smooth to reduce leverage on lifting nails. Wear gloves for wet work and household cleaning. Avoid manicures that involve pushing back or trimming the cuticle, as this trauma can worsen nail disease via the Köbner phenomenon. Clear nail varnish can disguise pitting and is cosmetically acceptable, though thick "gel" or acrylic nails may trap moisture and worsen onycholysis.

### 20.4 Clothing and Fabrics

Cotton and other natural, breathable fabrics are generally best tolerated. Tight clothing can create friction that triggers Köbner-effect lesions in folds and waistbands. Synthetic fabrics may trap heat and moisture. Some patients find that dark-coloured clothing is preferable for disguising scale shedding.

### 20.5 Sun Exposure

Moderate sun exposure benefits many psoriasis patients — UV light has a natural immunosuppressive effect on the skin. However, sunburn must be avoided as it triggers the Köbner phenomenon and can cause severe flares. Practical guidance: build up exposure gradually (10–15 minutes initially), avoid peak UV hours (11am–3pm), use sunscreen on unaffected skin, and be aware that some psoriasis medications (methotrexate, acitretin) increase photosensitivity.

### 20.6 Managing Flares at Work and Travel

Patients on biologic injections can generally travel freely; most biologics are stable for limited periods at room temperature (check individual drug guidance). Carry medication in hand luggage when flying, with a letter from the prescribing consultant confirming medical necessity. For work, planning ahead around injection schedules and understanding sick leave policies can reduce stress. Stress management itself matters: psychological stress is a well-documented trigger for psoriasis flares, creating a feedback loop that patients should be aware of.

### 20.7 Intimate Relationships and Genital Psoriasis

Genital psoriasis affects up to 60% of patients at some point and is frequently undisclosed due to embarrassment. It causes pain, irritation, and discomfort during sexual activity. Open communication with partners is important, as is discussing this area with a dermatologist — specific treatments are available (low-potency corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors) that are safe for genital skin.

---

## 21. Psoriasis and COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic raised urgent questions about whether patients on immunosuppressive biologic therapy were at increased risk of severe infection and whether their treatments would impair vaccine responses.

### 21.1 COVID-19 Risk on Biologics

Reassuringly, multiple studies and registries found that patients on biologic therapy for psoriasis were **not at increased risk of severe COVID-19** — and may even have had somewhat better outcomes than the general population. The leading hypothesis is that the cytokine storm driving severe COVID-19 involves TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 — the very cytokines that biologic therapies suppress. By dampening this inflammatory cascade, biologics may have inadvertently provided partial protection against the most dangerous phase of COVID-19 infection.

IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors appeared particularly favourable: large cohort studies showed that these drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious infections, in contrast to TNF inhibitors (where infliximab specifically showed a modest increase in serious infection risk) and methotrexate. Current guidelines do not recommend stopping biologic therapy during respiratory infections unless the treating physician advises otherwise on a case-by-case basis.

### 21.2 Vaccine Response

A key concern was whether immunosuppressive therapy would impair vaccine responses. The evidence is nuanced:

- **Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-23):** Seroconversion rates after completed COVID-19 vaccination were 96% or higher in most studies — comparable to healthy controls. Antibody titres were numerically slightly lower but not significantly different. Cellular immune responses (T-cell function) were largely unaffected.
- **Methotrexate** was the exception. It consistently impaired humoral (antibody) responses, with lower seroconversion rates and lower antibody titres. Some guidelines recommend temporarily pausing methotrexate for 1–2 weeks after each vaccine dose to optimise response, though this must be weighed against the risk of psoriasis flare.

Current NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation) Delphi consensus recommendations advise continuing biologic therapy without modification when receiving non-live vaccines (including all COVID-19 vaccines) and considering temporary interruption of methotrexate. Live vaccines should generally not be given to patients on biologic therapy, though the risk is primarily theoretical for IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors.

---

## 22. Psoriasis Registries and Real-World Data

Clinical trials demonstrate efficacy under idealised conditions. Real-world data from patient registries provide a complementary view of how treatments perform in everyday practice — including in patients who would have been excluded from trials.

### 22.1 Major Registries

Several national registries collect long-term prospective data on psoriasis patients receiving systemic and biologic therapies:

- **BADBIR** (British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register, UK/Ireland): The largest European psoriasis biologics registry, with over 20,000 registered patients. It tracks biologic safety, drug survival, and patient outcomes longitudinally.
- **PSOLAR** (Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry): A large US-based international registry (over 12,000 patients) that provided key long-term safety data for multiple biologics, including rates of serious infections, malignancy, and cardiovascular events.
- **PsoBest** (Germany): A national registry tracking over 10,000 patients on systemic therapies.
- **BioCAPTURE** (Netherlands): A registry focusing on biological therapies in psoriasis with long-term follow-up.

### 22.2 Key Findings from Real-World Data

Real-world evidence has confirmed and extended several findings from clinical trials. Drug survival — the length of time patients remain on a given therapy — provides a proxy for real-world effectiveness and tolerability. IL-23 inhibitors consistently demonstrate the highest drug survival rates, followed by IL-17 inhibitors and then TNF inhibitors. Real-world PASI 90 and 100 response rates tend to be somewhat lower than in clinical trials, reflecting the broader patient populations treated in practice. Registry data from BADBIR have also demonstrated no increased overall suicide risk in moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients compared to the general population, though patients with psychiatric comorbidities have significantly elevated suicidal ideation and self-harm rates — informing the recommendation for routine mental health screening.

---

## 23. Traditional Medicine Approaches

Many patients with psoriasis explore traditional and complementary medicine systems, either alongside or instead of conventional treatment. This section reviews the most commonly encountered approaches and the available evidence.

### 23.1 Ayurveda

In the Ayurvedic tradition, psoriasis (most closely matching the concept of *Kushtha*) is attributed to an imbalance of *Vata* and *Kapha* doshas, with accumulation of toxins (*Ama*) in the body. Ayurvedic treatments include *Panchakarma* (a five-step detoxification process including therapeutic vomiting, purgation, and enema), herbal preparations (turmeric, neem, guduchi, and aloe vera), and dietary modification. Some small studies from India have reported improvements in PASI scores with Panchakarma, but all have significant methodological limitations: small sample sizes, lack of blinding, absence of placebo controls, and potential for publication bias. No Ayurvedic treatment has been evaluated in a large randomised controlled trial for psoriasis. Turmeric (curcumin) has shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, but clinical translation remains limited (see Section 9.7).

### 23.2 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

TCM views psoriasis as resulting from *Blood Heat* (血热), *Blood Stasis* (血瘀), or *Blood Dryness* (血燥), with treatment typically involving herbal formulations tailored to the patient's constitutional pattern. Indigo naturalis (青黛, *Qing Dai*), a plant-derived blue powder, has received the most rigorous evaluation of any TCM treatment for psoriasis. A small Taiwanese RCT found it effective as a topical preparation, though it can cause blue skin staining and, when taken orally, has been associated with liver injury and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tripterygium wilfordii (Thunder God Vine) has demonstrated immunosuppressive properties and some efficacy in psoriasis, but serious toxicities including hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, and male infertility limit its use. Acupuncture has been explored for itch relief and stress reduction, with some small studies suggesting modest benefit, though sham-controlled trials have not demonstrated consistent superiority.

### 23.3 Evidence Summary

No traditional medicine system has produced evidence meeting the standard required for clinical recommendation in international guidelines. However, some individual compounds (curcumin, indigo naturalis) have biological plausibility and warrant further rigorous investigation. Patients should be encouraged to disclose use of traditional therapies to their dermatologist, particularly because herbal preparations can interact with prescribed medications (e.g., hepatotoxic herbs combined with methotrexate) or delay initiation of effective conventional treatment.

## 25. Conclusion

Psoriasis is a paradigmatic example of how basic immunological research can transform the treatment of a chronic disease. The journey from recognising psoriasis as merely a skin condition to understanding it as a systemic, T cell-mediated inflammatory disease driven by the IL-23/IL-17 axis — and then translating that knowledge into targeted biologic therapies that achieve near-complete skin clearance — represents one of the great success stories of modern medicine.

Yet significant challenges remain. Psoriasis cannot yet be cured: current therapies suppress the inflammatory process but do not address the underlying immunological memory that drives relapse. Comorbidities — particularly cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome — continue to contribute to excess morbidity and mortality. Access to biologic therapies remains limited in many parts of the world due to cost, and 76% of countries lack data on psoriasis epidemiology [(Dimmock, Aalemi et al., 2024)](https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article/191/Supplement_3/ljae360.061/7916197).

Future research priorities include targeting TRM cells to achieve durable remission, developing affordable oral therapies with biologic-level efficacy, clarifying the role of the microbiome, and implementing personalised treatment strategies guided by genetic and molecular profiling.
