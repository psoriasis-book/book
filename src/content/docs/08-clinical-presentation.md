## 8.1 Types of Psoriasis

Psoriasis encompasses several clinical variants:

- **Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)**: The most common form, accounting for approximately 80–90% of cases. It presents as well-demarcated, raised, erythematous (red) plaques covered with silvery-white scales, typically on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.
- **Guttate psoriasis**: Characterised by small, droplet-shaped lesions scattered across the trunk and limbs. Often triggered by streptococcal throat infection, particularly in young adults.
- **Inverse (flexural) psoriasis**: Affects skin folds (axillae, groin, submammary areas) with smooth, red, inflamed patches lacking the typical scaling.
- **Pustular psoriasis**: Features sterile (non-infectious) pustules. Can be localised (palmoplantar pustulosis) or generalised (a medical emergency). Generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP) has a distinct genetic and immunological profile involving the IL-36 pathway.
- **Erythrodermic psoriasis**: A rare, severe form involving widespread inflammation and erythema covering most of the body surface. It can be life-threatening and requires urgent medical attention.
- **Nail psoriasis**: Affects fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, discolouration, onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), and subungual hyperkeratosis. Present in up to 50% of patients with plaque psoriasis.

## 8.2 Histopathology (What Psoriatic Skin Looks Like Under a Microscope)

Under the microscope, psoriatic skin shows characteristic features: acanthosis (thickening of the epidermis — the skin's outer layer), elongation of rete ridges (finger-like projections of the epidermis pushing down into the dermis — the deeper skin layer), dilated and tortuous (swollen and twisted) blood vessels in the dermal papillae (the bumpy upper surface of the dermis), a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (a collection of various immune cells that have migrated into the tissue) of T cells and dendritic cells in the dermis, and collections of neutrophils called Munro microabscesses (tiny pockets of white blood cells) in the epidermis [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).

## 8.3 Measurement of Severity

Disease severity is commonly measured using the **Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)**, which scores redness, thickness, scaling, and the percentage of body surface area affected, on a scale from 0 to 72. A PASI score below 10 generally indicates mild disease, while scores above 10 indicate moderate-to-severe disease. Treatment efficacy in clinical trials is typically reported as the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 (75% improvement), PASI 90, or PASI 100 (complete clearance). The **Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)** measures the impact on quality of life [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).
