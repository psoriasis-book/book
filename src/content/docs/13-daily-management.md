Clinical papers rarely address the everyday practicalities of living with psoriasis. This section covers the practical knowledge that patients commonly seek.

## 13.1 Skin Care Routine

**Moisturising** is the single most important daily intervention [(NICE CG153, 2017)](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg153). Generous and frequent application of an emollient — ideally within 3 minutes of bathing while the skin is still damp — helps seal in moisture, reduce scale, and maintain the skin barrier. Ointment-based (greasy) emollients are most effective but can be cosmetically unacceptable during the day; cream-based emollients offer a reasonable daytime compromise. Common effective emollients available in the UK include Cetraben, Epaderm, Hydromol, and Diprobase. Avoid products with fragrances, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), or alcohol, which can irritate psoriatic skin.

**Bathing.** Lukewarm (not hot) baths or showers are preferred; hot water strips natural oils from the skin and can trigger flares. Bath additives such as colloidal oatmeal or emollient bath oils can soothe skin. Limit bath time to 10–15 minutes. Gently pat (don't rub) skin dry. Some patients find Dead Sea salt baths helpful, though clinical evidence is limited.

**Scale removal.** For thick plaques, gentle scale removal before applying topical treatments improves drug penetration. Salicylic acid preparations (2–10%) soften scale. Coconut oil applied under an occlusive wrap (cling film) overnight is a common home remedy for stubborn plaques. Never pick or scratch at scales — this risks triggering the Köbner phenomenon and worsening disease.

## 13.2 Scalp Care

Scalp psoriasis is one of the most common and difficult-to-treat sites, affecting approximately 45–56% of all psoriasis patients and frequently cited as the most bothersome location for disease. The scalp's dense hair coverage makes topical application difficult, reduces treatment adherence, and limits drug penetration. The psychological impact is substantial — visible flaking causes embarrassment, and many patients avoid hairdressers or social situations.

**A practical three-step approach:**

1. **Descale first.** Apply a descaling preparation (coconut oil, salicylic acid 2–5%, or a dedicated scalp oil such as Cocois ointment or Dermax) before washing. Leave for at least 30 minutes — or overnight under a shower cap for thick plaques — to soften scale. Thick scale physically blocks absorption of active treatments, so this step is essential.
2. **Medicated shampoo.** Use a coal tar-based shampoo (such as Polytar or T/Gel), ketoconazole-based shampoo, or salicylic acid shampoo 2–3 times per week, leaving it on the scalp for 5 minutes before rinsing. On non-treatment days, use a gentle, fragrance-free shampoo.
3. **Apply active treatment to clean, de-scaled scalp.** Prescribed topical treatments — calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate gel or foam (Enstilar, Dovobet), potent corticosteroid scalp applications (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate lotion or shampoo), or calcipotriol scalp solution — penetrate far better when applied after descaling and washing.

**Vehicle matters.** Solutions, lotions, foams, and gels are generally better tolerated on the scalp than ointments or creams, which can be difficult to apply through hair and feel greasy. The calcipotriol/betamethasone foam formulation (Enstilar) has been shown to improve adherence compared with ointment formulations.

**For moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis** that does not respond to topical therapy, biologic treatments — particularly IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab) — have demonstrated high scalp-specific response rates in clinical trials, with complete scalp clearance achieved in over 50% of patients. Avoid aggressive brushing, scratching, or picking at scalp plaques, as this risks triggering the Köbner phenomenon.

## 13.3 Nail Care

Nail psoriasis is slow to respond to treatment because nails grow slowly (fingernails: 3–4 mm/month, toenails: 1 mm/month). Keep nails trimmed short and filed smooth to reduce leverage on lifting nails. Wear gloves for wet work and household cleaning. Avoid manicures that involve pushing back or trimming the cuticle, as this trauma can worsen nail disease via the Köbner phenomenon. Clear nail varnish can disguise pitting and is cosmetically acceptable, though thick "gel" or acrylic nails may trap moisture and worsen onycholysis.

## 13.4 Clothing and Fabrics

Cotton and other natural, breathable fabrics are generally best tolerated. Tight clothing can create friction that triggers Köbner-effect lesions in folds and waistbands. Synthetic fabrics may trap heat and moisture. Some patients find that dark-coloured clothing is preferable for disguising scale shedding.

## 13.5 Sun Exposure

Moderate sun exposure benefits many psoriasis patients — UV light has a natural immunosuppressive effect on the skin. However, sunburn must be avoided as it triggers the Köbner phenomenon and can cause severe flares. Practical guidance: build up exposure gradually (10–15 minutes initially), avoid peak UV hours (11am–3pm), use sunscreen on unaffected skin, and be aware that some psoriasis medications (methotrexate, acitretin) increase photosensitivity.

## 13.6 Managing Flares at Work and Travel

Patients on biologic injections can generally travel freely; most biologics are stable for limited periods at room temperature (check individual drug guidance). Carry medication in hand luggage when flying, with a letter from the prescribing consultant confirming medical necessity. For work, planning ahead around injection schedules and understanding sick leave policies can reduce stress. Stress management itself matters: psychological stress is a well-documented trigger for psoriasis flares, creating a feedback loop that patients should be aware of.

## 13.7 Intimate Relationships and Genital Psoriasis

Genital psoriasis affects up to 60% of patients at some point and is frequently undisclosed due to embarrassment [(Meeuwis et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21569104/). It causes pain, irritation, and discomfort during sexual activity. Open communication with partners is important, as is discussing this area with a dermatologist — specific treatments are available (low-potency corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors) that are safe for genital skin.
