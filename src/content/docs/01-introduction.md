Psoriasis is one of the most common and most studied inflammatory skin diseases in medicine, yet we still don't completely understand how it develops. The disease follows a chronic, relapsing-remitting course (symptoms come and go in cycles) and manifests most commonly as raised, red, scaly patches called **plaques**. These plaques result from an abnormally accelerated cycle of skin cell growth: where a normal skin cell matures and sheds over the course of roughly 40–56 days, psoriatic skin cells complete this cycle in just 4–7 days. The result is a visible build-up of thick, silvery scales on the skin's surface.

But the visible skin manifestation is only one dimension of the disease. Over the past three decades, research has firmly established psoriasis as a systemic inflammatory condition, one that affects not just the skin but the joints, cardiovascular system, metabolism, and mental health. Patients with severe psoriasis have a life expectancy approximately 3–5 years shorter than the general population, with cardiovascular disease contributing significantly to this gap [(Ni & Chiu, 2014)](https://www.dovepress.com/psoriasis-and-comorbidities-links-and-risks-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID).

The modern understanding of psoriasis represents a triumph of translational immunology (turning laboratory discoveries about the immune system into real treatments). Once researchers identified the specific immune pathway driving the disease, the **IL-23/Th17 axis**, everything changed. New biologic therapies could now target it directly. Most patients achieve complete or near-complete skin clearance [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).
