Psoriasis is one of the most common and most studied inflammatory skin diseases in medicine, yet its pathogenesis (the biological process by which the disease develops) is still not completely understood. The disease follows a chronic, relapsing-remitting course — meaning symptoms come and go in cycles — and manifests most commonly as raised, red, scaly patches (called **plaques**) on the skin. These plaques are caused by an abnormally accelerated cycle of skin cell growth: where a normal skin cell matures and sheds over the course of roughly 28–30 days, psoriatic skin cells complete this cycle in just 3–5 days, resulting in a visible build-up of thick, silvery scales on the skin's surface.

However, the visible skin manifestation is only one dimension of the disease. Over the past three decades, research has firmly established psoriasis as a systemic inflammatory condition — one that affects not just the skin, but the joints, cardiovascular system, metabolism, and mental health. Patients with severe psoriasis have been shown to have a life expectancy approximately 3–5 years shorter than the general population, with cardiovascular disease contributing significantly to this discrepancy [(Ni & Chiu, 2014)](https://www.dovepress.com/psoriasis-and-comorbidities-links-and-risks-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID).

The modern understanding of psoriasis represents a triumph of translational immunology (turning laboratory discoveries about the immune system into real treatments). The discovery that the disease is primarily driven by a specific arm of the immune system — the **IL-23/Th17 axis** — has led directly to the development of highly effective biologic therapies (drugs made from living cells that target specific parts of the immune system, as opposed to traditional chemical drugs) that can achieve complete or near-complete skin clearance in the majority of patients [(Armstrong & Read, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427307/).
