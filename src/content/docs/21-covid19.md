The COVID-19 pandemic raised urgent questions about whether patients on immunosuppressive biologic therapy were at increased risk of severe infection and whether their treatments would impair vaccine responses.

## 21.1 COVID-19 Risk on Biologics

Reassuringly, multiple studies and registries found that patients on biologic therapy for psoriasis were **not at increased risk of severe COVID-19** — and may even have had somewhat better outcomes than the general population. The PsoProtect global registry study found that biologic use was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 hospitalisation (adjusted OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18–0.98) compared with non-biologic systemic therapy, with 93% of biologic-treated patients fully recovering [(Mahil et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33075408/). The leading hypothesis is that the cytokine storm driving severe COVID-19 involves TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 — the very cytokines that biologic therapies suppress. By dampening this inflammatory cascade, biologics may have inadvertently provided partial protection against the most dangerous phase of COVID-19 infection.

IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors appeared particularly favourable: large cohort studies showed that these drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious infections. BADBIR registry data had previously established that infliximab specifically carries a higher incidence of serious infections compared with other biologics and non-biologic systemics [(Yiu et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30070708/), and the OpenSAFELY platform analysis confirmed that broader immunosuppression was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [(MacKenna et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35698725/). Current guidelines do not recommend stopping biologic therapy during respiratory infections unless the treating physician advises otherwise on a case-by-case basis.

## 21.2 Vaccine Response

A key concern was whether immunosuppressive therapy would impair vaccine responses. The evidence is nuanced:

- **Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-23):** A longitudinal cohort study found that seroconversion after a completed two-dose COVID-19 vaccination course was achieved in 100% of participants on targeted biological therapies — comparable to healthy controls. Antibody titres were numerically slightly lower but not significantly different. Cellular immune responses (T-cell function) were largely unaffected [(Mahil et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34778846/).
- **Methotrexate** was the exception. It consistently impaired humoral (antibody) responses: only 62% of methotrexate-treated patients achieved adequate antibody response after vaccination, and up to one-third lacked CD8+ T-cell activation [(Haberman et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34035003/). Follow-up data confirmed that both methotrexate and TNF inhibitors were associated with reduced long-term immunogenicity [(Haberman et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35403000/). Some guidelines recommend temporarily pausing methotrexate for 1–2 weeks after each vaccine dose to optimise response, though this must be weighed against the risk of psoriasis flare.

Current NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation) Delphi consensus recommendations advise continuing biologic therapy without modification when receiving non-live vaccines (including all COVID-19 vaccines) and considering temporary interruption of methotrexate [(Gelfand et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33422626/). Live vaccines should generally not be given to patients on biologic therapy, though the risk is primarily theoretical for IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors.
