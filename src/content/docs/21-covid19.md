The COVID-19 pandemic raised urgent questions about whether patients on immunosuppressive biologic therapy were at increased risk of severe infection and whether their treatments would impair vaccine responses.

## 21.1 COVID-19 Risk on Biologics

Reassuringly, multiple studies and registries found that patients on biologic therapy for psoriasis were **not at increased risk of severe COVID-19** — and may even have had somewhat better outcomes than the general population. The leading hypothesis is that the cytokine storm driving severe COVID-19 involves TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17 — the very cytokines that biologic therapies suppress. By dampening this inflammatory cascade, biologics may have inadvertently provided partial protection against the most dangerous phase of COVID-19 infection.

IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors appeared particularly favourable: large cohort studies showed that these drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious infections, in contrast to TNF inhibitors (where infliximab specifically showed a modest increase in serious infection risk) and methotrexate. Current guidelines do not recommend stopping biologic therapy during respiratory infections unless the treating physician advises otherwise on a case-by-case basis.

## 21.2 Vaccine Response

A key concern was whether immunosuppressive therapy would impair vaccine responses. The evidence is nuanced:

- **Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-23):** Seroconversion rates after completed COVID-19 vaccination were 96% or higher in most studies — comparable to healthy controls. Antibody titres were numerically slightly lower but not significantly different. Cellular immune responses (T-cell function) were largely unaffected.
- **Methotrexate** was the exception. It consistently impaired humoral (antibody) responses, with lower seroconversion rates and lower antibody titres. Some guidelines recommend temporarily pausing methotrexate for 1–2 weeks after each vaccine dose to optimise response, though this must be weighed against the risk of psoriasis flare.

Current NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation) Delphi consensus recommendations advise continuing biologic therapy without modification when receiving non-live vaccines (including all COVID-19 vaccines) and considering temporary interruption of methotrexate. Live vaccines should generally not be given to patients on biologic therapy, though the risk is primarily theoretical for IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors.
