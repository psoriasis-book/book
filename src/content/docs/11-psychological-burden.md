Psoriasis exerts a psychological toll that is frequently disproportionate to the physical severity of the disease. A patient with limited disease on the hands, face, or genitals may experience greater psychological distress than a patient with extensive disease on the trunk and limbs. Understanding the mental health dimensions of psoriasis is essential for holistic care.

## 11.1 Depression

Depression is the most-studied psychiatric comorbidity in psoriasis. A landmark UK population-based cohort study (n = 146,042 psoriasis patients vs. 766,950 controls) found adjusted hazard ratios for depression of 1.39 overall (95% CI 1.37–1.41), rising to 1.72 for severe psoriasis (95% CI 1.57–1.88). The authors estimated that, in the UK alone, over 10,400 diagnoses of depression per year are attributable to psoriasis. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among psoriasis patients may reach 62% in some studies, with 14.9% meeting clinical diagnostic thresholds. Depression is more prevalent among women with psoriasis and among those with more severe disease, psoriatic arthritis, or multiple comorbidities.

The relationship is likely bidirectional: psoriasis causes depression through psychological and social mechanisms (stigma, shame, restricted activities, relationship difficulties, reduced employment), but depression may also worsen psoriasis through biological pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines elevated in psoriasis — including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-17 — are also elevated in major depressive disorder, suggesting shared inflammatory mechanisms. Biologic therapies such as anti-IL-17A antibodies have been shown to produce both depression remission and reduction in serum CRP in patients with comorbid psoriasis and depression, supporting a neuroinflammatory link.

## 11.2 Suicidal Ideation and Suicide

The relationship between psoriasis and suicidality has been examined in multiple systematic reviews with somewhat conflicting results. The UK cohort study above found an adjusted hazard ratio for suicidality of 1.44 (95% CI 1.32–1.57). A well-controlled pan-European study of 626 adult patients reported a 2.5-fold greater risk of suicidal ideation compared to controls. Among tertiary patients with moderate-to-severe disease, up to 47% report lifetime suicidal thoughts.

The 2025 BADBIR analysis (British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register) specifically examined suicide risk in patients with clinically confirmed moderate-to-severe psoriasis. It found that patients with a history of psychiatric comorbidity had significantly increased rates of all suicidality outcomes. However, the overall suicide rate among psoriasis patients was not significantly elevated compared to the general population. The authors emphasised the high prevalence of undiagnosed depression and the need for routine mental health assessment at every dermatology appointment.

## 11.3 Stigma, Shame, and Social Isolation

Unlike many chronic diseases, psoriasis is visible. Patients report being stared at, refused service at hairdressers and swimming pools, asked whether their condition is contagious, and experiencing rejection in intimate relationships. A concept termed "social skin" has been used in the dermatology literature to describe how the skin mediates social identity and interpersonal connection, and how visible skin disease disrupts this.

The WHO's 2016 Global Report on Psoriasis highlighted that patients frequently feel humiliated, stigmatised, and socially excluded, and called on governments to recognise psoriasis as a serious non-communicable disease. The report noted that patients with psoriasis often change their behaviour to avoid situations where their skin might be visible: avoiding swimming, changing how they dress, declining social invitations, and withdrawing from sexual relationships.

## 11.4 Impact on Employment and Productivity

Psoriasis significantly affects working life. Studies have documented increased absenteeism, presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), and career limitation. Patients with psoriasis affecting the hands face particular occupational challenges, as do those in public-facing roles where visible skin disease attracts attention or concern from colleagues and customers.

## 11.5 Psychological Interventions

Growing evidence supports incorporating psychological support into psoriasis care. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction, and habit reversal training (for itch-scratch cycles) have all shown benefit in small trials. Current guidelines increasingly advocate routine mental health screening — using validated tools such as the PHQ-2 or PHQ-9 for depression and asking about suicidal ideation — at every dermatology appointment, particularly when starting, changing, or reviewing systemic treatment.
