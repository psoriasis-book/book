Psoriasis is a paradigmatic example of how basic immunological research can transform the treatment of a chronic disease. The journey from recognising psoriasis as merely a skin condition to understanding it as a systemic, T cell-mediated inflammatory disease driven by the IL-23/IL-17 axis, and then translating that knowledge into targeted biologic therapies that achieve near-complete skin clearance, is one of the great success stories of modern medicine.

Yet significant challenges remain. Psoriasis can't yet be cured: current therapies suppress the inflammatory process but don't address the underlying immunological memory that drives relapse. Comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, continue to contribute to excess morbidity and mortality. Access to biologic therapies remains limited in many parts of the world due to cost, and 76% of countries lack data on psoriasis epidemiology [(Dimmock, Aalemi et al., 2024)](https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article/191/Supplement_3/ljae360.061/7916197).

Future research priorities include targeting TRM cells to achieve durable remission, developing affordable oral therapies with biologic-level efficacy, clarifying the role of the microbiome, and implementing personalised treatment strategies guided by genetic and molecular profiling.
