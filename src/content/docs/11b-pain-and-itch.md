Pain and itch are among the most distressing symptoms reported by psoriasis patients, yet they receive remarkably little attention compared with the visible signs of the disease. Both are mediated by a complex neuroimmune dialogue between sensory nerve fibres, immune cells, and keratinocytes — the same cross-talk described in Section 20.8 (neuroimmunology). This chapter examines the molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms and the therapeutic implications.

## 11b.1 The Neuroscience of Psoriatic Itch

Pruritus (itch) is reported by 60–90% of psoriasis patients and is frequently cited as the single most bothersome symptom — more troublesome even than visible plaques. Psoriatic itch differs from itch in other conditions (such as eczema) in its mechanisms, and current treatments often fail to adequately control it.

**The neuro-immune itch circuit** in psoriasis involves several key molecular players:

**IL-31 and its receptor.** IL-31, produced by Th2 cells and activated macrophages, acts through the **IL-31 receptor A (IL-31RA)** expressed on sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) — the clusters of nerve cell bodies that relay sensory information from the skin to the spinal cord. IL-31 binding triggers intracellular calcium release and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these neurons, directly generating itch signals [(Jaworecka et al., 2025)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10753-025-02385-3).

**TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels.** Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) are ion channels on sensory nerve endings that detect heat, chemicals, and inflammatory mediators. In psoriatic skin:
- **TRPV1 is upregulated**, lowering the threshold for itch and pain perception.
- **Nerve growth factor (NGF)**, which is elevated in psoriatic lesions (Section 20.8), further sensitises TRPV1 channels by lowering their activation threshold.
- The skin microbiota stimulates NGF production in mast cells, adding a microbial contribution to itch generation [(Takahashi & Yamasaki, 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576923003843).

**Neuropeptide amplification.** When TRPV1+ nerve endings are activated, they release **substance P** and **CGRP** (calcitonin gene-related peptide) — the same neuropeptides described in the neuroimmunology section (Section 20.8). Substance P activates mast cells via the NK1 receptor, causing degranulation and release of histamine, tryptase, and further inflammatory mediators. CGRP amplifies IL-23/IL-17 signalling. This creates a **neurogenic inflammation loop** in which itch signals generate more inflammation, which generates more itch.

**Emerging therapeutic targets for itch:**

| Target | Agent | Status | Mechanism |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------|
| TRPV1 | Asivatrep (PAC-14028) | Phase 2/3 | Topical TRPV1 antagonist; most clinically advanced anti-itch agent |
| NK1R | Serlopitant | Phase 2 completed | Blocks substance P signalling; mixed results in psoriasis |
| IL-31RA | Nemolizumab | Approved (atopic dermatitis) | Anti-IL-31RA antibody; being explored for psoriatic itch |
| JAK pathway | Ruxolitinib cream | Approved (atopic dermatitis) | Topical JAK inhibitor; reduces itch-associated cytokine signalling |

**Research stage: Emerging.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Preclinical mechanisms well-established; early clinical data for anti-itch agents, though most are not yet specifically approved for psoriatic itch.

## 11b.2 Pain in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis

Pain in psoriasis extends beyond the joint involvement of PsA (Section 10a). Cutaneous pain — burning, stinging, and soreness of psoriatic plaques — is reported by 42% of patients and is distinct from itch, though both share some neural pathways.

A 2025 study of 114 psoriatic arthritis patients systematically characterised pain mechanisms and found [(Akdeniz et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12010264/):
- **Central sensitisation** (amplified pain processing in the spinal cord and brain) was present in **43%** of patients
- **Neuropathic pain** (pain from nerve damage or dysfunction) was present in **23.5%**
- **Fibromyalgia** (widespread pain with central sensitisation) was diagnosed in **25.5%**

**Pain mechanisms in psoriasis follow a progression:**

1. **Peripheral nociception**: Inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-17, IL-1β, prostaglandins) directly activate nociceptors (pain-sensing nerve endings) in the skin via TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels. This produces the burning and stinging sensation of active plaques.

2. **Peripheral sensitisation**: Prolonged inflammation lowers the activation threshold of nociceptors through phosphorylation of TRPV1 by protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Stimuli that would normally be painless (light touch, warm water) become painful — a phenomenon called **allodynia** [(Puig et al., 2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mus.28196).

3. **Central sensitisation**: Persistent nociceptive input from the periphery causes maladaptive changes in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons, including increased excitability and expansion of receptive fields. This amplifies pain perception beyond the original stimulus and beyond the original body region — explaining why some patients experience widespread pain.

4. **Peripheral polyneuropathy**: Psoriasis and PsA are associated with increased risk of peripheral polyneuropathy — damage to the small nerve fibres that detect temperature and pain. This may contribute to the persistent burning and tingling sensations reported by patients.

**Clinical implications**: Pain in psoriasis is often undertreated because it is attributed solely to joint disease (and therefore considered the domain of rheumatology) or dismissed as secondary to itch. Recognising the central sensitisation component is important because it responds poorly to conventional analgesics and anti-inflammatory biologics; it may require targeted approaches such as duloxetine, pregabalin, or cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic pain.

**Research stage: Emerging.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Cross-sectional studies with mechanistic characterisation; pain phenotyping studies now being conducted.

## 11b.3 Current Limitations and Future Directions

Current biologic therapies — while highly effective at clearing skin plaques and reducing joint inflammation — have **limited impact on neurological symptoms**. Patients who achieve PASI 90 or PASI 100 may still report residual itch, pain, and burning, likely because:

1. **Biologics target immune pathways but not neural pathways**: IL-17 and IL-23 blockade reduces immune-mediated inflammation but does not directly modulate sensory nerve sensitisation or neuropeptide release.
2. **Structural nerve changes persist**: The hyperinnervation of psoriatic skin (increased nerve fibre density — Section 20.8) may take longer to resolve than epidermal thickening, or may not resolve at all after chronic disease.
3. **Central sensitisation is self-sustaining**: Once established, central pain amplification can persist independently of the original peripheral stimulus.

This represents a significant **unmet therapeutic need**. Future approaches may include:
- **Anti-itch biologics** (nemolizumab, asivatrep) used as adjuncts to standard psoriasis biologics
- **Topical neuromodulators** targeting TRPV1 or NK1R
- **Combination strategies** addressing both immune and neural components simultaneously
- **Neuromodulation techniques** (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture) as adjunctive therapies for chronic pain

**Research stage: Experimental.** **Evidence strength: Low.** This section describes an unmet need with early-pipeline approaches; no dedicated trials of anti-itch/anti-pain agents specifically in psoriasis have completed Phase 3.
