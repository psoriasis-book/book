Psoriasis develops when environmental factors interact with genetic susceptibility to initiate or exacerbate the immune cascade described above. The following triggers are well-characterised in the literature.

## 7.1 Infections

**Streptococcal infection** (particularly pharyngitis/strep throat) is the best-established infectious trigger for psoriasis and is especially linked to the onset of guttate psoriasis. Streptococcal M protein shares structural similarity with keratin in human skin, potentially leading to cross-reactive T cell activation — a form of molecular mimicry (where the immune system confuses a bacterial protein with a similar-looking human protein, and attacks both) [(Griffiths et al., 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32549-6/abstract). Other infections, including HIV, may also trigger or exacerbate psoriasis.

## 7.2 Obesity

Obesity is both a risk factor for developing psoriasis and a factor that worsens existing disease. Adipose tissue (body fat) is metabolically active and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines called adipokines (signalling molecules released specifically by fat cells), including TNF-α and IL-6, which contribute to systemic inflammation. Obesity also reduces the efficacy of many psoriasis treatments, and weight loss has been shown to improve disease severity and treatment response [(Zhu et al., 2024; Al-Kufi et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12047224/).

## 7.3 Psychological Stress

Stress is one of the most commonly cited triggers for psoriasis flares, reported by a significant proportion of patients. The mechanism may involve promotion of neurogenic inflammation (inflammation triggered by the nervous system), changes in the neuroendocrine system — particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the body's central stress-response system connecting the brain to the adrenal glands — and redistribution of immune cells to the skin [(Ko et al., 2019)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6629583/).

## 7.4 Smoking

Smoking is an independent risk factor for psoriasis onset and severity. Tobacco smoke causes oxidative stress and free radical production, interfering with signalling pathways relevant to psoriasis including NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT [(Naldi, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5683129/). Smokers with psoriasis also show reduced treatment response. One study found that patients with longer smoking duration and higher smoking intensity had significantly lower rates of achieving PASI 75 after eight weeks of treatment [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Tobacco-smoking-negatively-influences-the-achievement-of-greater-than-three-quarters,184143,0,2.html). Smoking also alters the gut microbiota in ways that may promote psoriatic inflammation [(Luca et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11110215/).

## 7.5 Alcohol

Excessive alcohol consumption increases the expression of TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and plasma levels of TNF-α receptor, upregulates genes promoting lymphocyte and keratinocyte proliferation, and may facilitate skin infections that act as psoriasis triggers. Alcohol misuse affects approximately one-third of people with psoriasis and worsens therapeutic compliance [(Brenaut et al., 2022; cited in Caso et al., 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541512/).

## 7.6 Medications

Several classes of medications can trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, including **beta-blockers**, **lithium**, **antimalarials** (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine), **interferon-alpha**, **ACE inhibitors**, and rapid withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids [(Griffiths et al., 2021)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32549-6/abstract).

## 7.7 Physical Trauma (Koebner Phenomenon)

Skin injury — cuts, burns, tattoos, surgical wounds, or even friction — can trigger psoriatic lesions at the site of trauma. This is known as the **Koebner phenomenon** or isomorphic response, and it occurs in approximately 25–50% of psoriasis patients.

## 7.8 Climate and UV Exposure

Cold, dry climates are associated with worsening psoriasis, while moderate sunlight exposure (particularly UV-B radiation) can improve symptoms — forming the basis for phototherapy treatments. However, sunburn can trigger flares. The geographic gradient of psoriasis prevalence (higher at higher latitudes) may partly reflect reduced UV exposure and lower vitamin D levels [(Dairov et al., 2024)](https://www.clinmedkaz.org/download/prevalence-incidence-gender-and-age-distribution-and-economic-burden-of-psoriasis-worldwide-and-in-14497.pdf).
