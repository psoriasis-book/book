Clinical papers rarely address the everyday practicalities of living with psoriasis. This section covers the practical knowledge that patients commonly seek.

## 20.1 Skin Care Routine

**Moisturising** is the single most important daily intervention [(NICE CG153, 2017)](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg153). Generous and frequent application of an emollient — ideally within 3 minutes of bathing while the skin is still damp — helps seal in moisture, reduce scale, and maintain the skin barrier. Ointment-based (greasy) emollients are most effective but can be cosmetically unacceptable during the day; cream-based emollients offer a reasonable daytime compromise. Common effective emollients available in the UK include Cetraben, Epaderm, Hydromol, and Diprobase. Avoid products with fragrances, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), or alcohol, which can irritate psoriatic skin.

**Bathing.** Lukewarm (not hot) baths or showers are preferred; hot water strips natural oils from the skin and can trigger flares. Bath additives such as colloidal oatmeal or emollient bath oils can soothe skin. Limit bath time to 10–15 minutes. Gently pat (don't rub) skin dry. Some patients find Dead Sea salt baths helpful, though clinical evidence is limited.

**Scale removal.** For thick plaques, gentle scale removal before applying topical treatments improves drug penetration. Salicylic acid preparations (2–10%) soften scale. Coconut oil applied under an occlusive wrap (cling film) overnight is a common home remedy for stubborn plaques. Never pick or scratch at scales — this risks triggering the Köbner phenomenon and worsening disease.

## 20.2 Scalp Care

Scalp psoriasis is one of the most common and difficult-to-treat sites, affecting approximately 45–56% of all psoriasis patients and frequently cited as the most bothersome location for disease. The scalp's dense hair coverage makes topical application difficult, reduces treatment adherence, and limits drug penetration. The psychological impact is substantial — visible flaking causes embarrassment, and many patients avoid hairdressers or social situations.

**A practical three-step approach:**

1. **Descale first.** Apply a descaling preparation (coconut oil, salicylic acid 2–5%, or a dedicated scalp oil such as Cocois ointment or Dermax) before washing. Leave for at least 30 minutes — or overnight under a shower cap for thick plaques — to soften scale. Thick scale physically blocks absorption of active treatments, so this step is essential.
2. **Medicated shampoo.** Use a coal tar-based shampoo (such as Polytar or T/Gel), ketoconazole-based shampoo, or salicylic acid shampoo 2–3 times per week, leaving it on the scalp for 5 minutes before rinsing. On non-treatment days, use a gentle, fragrance-free shampoo.
3. **Apply active treatment to clean, de-scaled scalp.** Prescribed topical treatments — calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate gel or foam (Enstilar, Dovobet), potent corticosteroid scalp applications (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate lotion or shampoo), or calcipotriol scalp solution — penetrate far better when applied after descaling and washing.

**Vehicle matters.** Solutions, lotions, foams, and gels are generally better tolerated on the scalp than ointments or creams, which can be difficult to apply through hair and feel greasy. The calcipotriol/betamethasone foam formulation (Enstilar) has been shown to improve adherence compared with ointment formulations.

**For moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis** that does not respond to topical therapy, biologic treatments — particularly IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab) — have demonstrated high scalp-specific response rates in clinical trials, with complete scalp clearance achieved in over 50% of patients. Avoid aggressive brushing, scratching, or picking at scalp plaques, as this risks triggering the Köbner phenomenon.

## 20.3 Nail Care

Nail psoriasis is slow to respond to treatment because nails grow slowly (fingernails: 3–4 mm/month, toenails: 1 mm/month). Visible improvement typically takes 6–12 months even with effective therapy, so patience is essential. Severity can be assessed using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), which grades pitting, onycholysis, crumbling, and other features in each nail.

**Topical treatments** for mild nail disease include high-potency corticosteroids (e.g. clobetasol in nail lacquer form), vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol), and tacrolimus ointment applied to the nail folds. Intralesional corticosteroid injections into the nail matrix can be effective for localised disease but are painful and typically reserved for specialist clinics.

**Systemic treatments** are often required for moderate-to-severe nail psoriasis. Among biologics, IL-17 inhibitors (ixekizumab, secukinumab) and IL-23 inhibitors (risankizumab, guselkumab) have demonstrated the strongest nail clearance rates in clinical trials, significantly outperforming methotrexate. Bimekizumab also shows high nail response rates. For patients already on a biologic for skin psoriasis, nail improvement typically follows, though with a delay of several months.

**Practical nail care:** Keep nails trimmed short and filed smooth to reduce leverage on lifting nails. Wear gloves for wet work and household cleaning. Avoid manicures that involve pushing back or trimming the cuticle, as this trauma can worsen nail disease via the Köbner phenomenon. Clear nail varnish or medical-grade nail hardeners can disguise pitting and protect the nail plate. Thick "gel" or acrylic nails should be avoided as they may trap moisture and worsen onycholysis.

## 20.4 Clothing and Fabrics

Cotton and other natural, breathable fabrics are generally best tolerated. Tight clothing can create friction that triggers Köbner-effect lesions in folds and waistbands. Synthetic fabrics may trap heat and moisture. Some patients find that dark-coloured clothing is preferable for disguising scale shedding.

## 20.5 Sun Exposure

Moderate sun exposure benefits many psoriasis patients — UV light has a natural immunosuppressive effect on the skin. However, sunburn must be avoided as it triggers the Köbner phenomenon and can cause severe flares. Practical guidance: build up exposure gradually (10–15 minutes initially), avoid peak UV hours (11am–3pm), use sunscreen on unaffected skin, and be aware that some psoriasis medications (methotrexate, acitretin) increase photosensitivity.

## 20.6 Managing Flares at Work and Travel

Patients on biologic injections can generally travel freely; most biologics are stable for limited periods at room temperature (check individual drug guidance). Carry medication in hand luggage when flying, with a letter from the prescribing consultant confirming medical necessity. For work, planning ahead around injection schedules and understanding sick leave policies can reduce stress. Stress management itself matters: psychological stress is a well-documented trigger for psoriasis flares, creating a feedback loop that patients should be aware of.

## 20.7 Intimate Relationships and Genital Psoriasis

Genital psoriasis affects up to 60% of patients at some point and is frequently undisclosed due to embarrassment [(Meeuwis et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21569104/). A systematic review found sexual dysfunction prevalence ranging from 23% to 71% across studies of psoriasis patients, including reduced desire, arousal difficulties, pain during intercourse, and avoidance of sexual activity altogether [(Molina-Leyva et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25424331/). The impact is often disproportionate to the visible severity of disease elsewhere on the body.

**Clinical presentation.** Genital psoriasis typically appears as well-demarcated, erythematous (red) patches without the thick silvery scale seen at other body sites, because the moist environment of the genital area prevents scale accumulation. In men, it commonly affects the glans, shaft of the penis, and scrotum. In women, it affects the vulva, inguinal folds, and gluteal cleft. It is often misdiagnosed as fungal infection, contact dermatitis, or sexually transmitted infection.

**Treatment.** Genital skin is thin, moist, and highly permeable, increasing both drug absorption and the risk of side effects. Treatment guidance differs from other body sites:

- **Low-potency topical corticosteroids** (hydrocortisone 1%) are first-line for short-term use. Moderate-potency steroids may be used briefly for flares, but potent and very potent steroids should be avoided on genital skin due to the high risk of atrophy, striae, and telangiectasia.
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors** (tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, pimecrolimus 1% cream) are particularly valuable for genital psoriasis because they are effective, do not cause skin atrophy, and can be used longer-term. They are used off-label for this indication.
- **Emollients** should be used liberally. Avoid products containing fragrances, preservatives, or propylene glycol, which can irritate genital mucosa. Unperfumed emollient creams or ointments are preferred.
- **Newer non-steroidal topicals** (roflumilast cream, tapinarof) may have a role in genital psoriasis given their lack of atrophy risk, though specific genital data are limited.

**Communication and referral.** Patients rarely volunteer information about genital involvement; clinicians should routinely ask about it. Partners may benefit from reassurance that psoriasis is not contagious and not a sexually transmitted infection. Where sexual dysfunction is persistent, referral to psychosexual services may be appropriate.
