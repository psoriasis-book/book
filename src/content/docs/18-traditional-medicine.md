Many patients with psoriasis explore traditional and complementary medicine systems, either alongside or instead of conventional treatment. This section reviews the most commonly encountered approaches and the available evidence.

## 18.1 Ayurveda

In the Ayurvedic tradition, psoriasis (most closely matching the concept of *Kushtha*) is attributed to an imbalance of *Vata* and *Kapha* doshas, with accumulation of toxins (*Ama*) in the body. Ayurvedic treatments include *Panchakarma* (a five-step detoxification process including therapeutic vomiting, purgation, and enema), herbal preparations (turmeric, neem, guduchi, and aloe vera), and dietary modification. Some small studies from India have reported improvements in PASI scores with Panchakarma, but all have significant methodological limitations: small sample sizes, lack of blinding, absence of placebo controls, and potential for publication bias. No Ayurvedic treatment has been evaluated in a large randomised controlled trial for psoriasis. Turmeric (curcumin) has shown anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, but clinical translation remains limited (see Section 9.7).

## 18.2 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

TCM views psoriasis as resulting from *Blood Heat* (血热), *Blood Stasis* (血瘀), or *Blood Dryness* (血燥), with treatment typically involving herbal formulations tailored to the patient's constitutional pattern. Indigo naturalis (青黛, *Qing Dai*), a plant-derived blue powder, has received the most rigorous evaluation of any TCM treatment for psoriasis. A small Taiwanese RCT found it effective as a topical preparation, though it can cause blue skin staining and, when taken orally, has been associated with liver injury and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tripterygium wilfordii (Thunder God Vine) has demonstrated immunosuppressive properties and some efficacy in psoriasis, but serious toxicities including hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, and male infertility limit its use. Acupuncture has been explored for itch relief and stress reduction, with some small studies suggesting modest benefit, though sham-controlled trials have not demonstrated consistent superiority.

## 18.3 Evidence Summary

No traditional medicine system has produced evidence meeting the standard required for clinical recommendation in international guidelines. However, some individual compounds (curcumin, indigo naturalis) have biological plausibility and warrant further rigorous investigation. Patients should be encouraged to disclose use of traditional therapies to their dermatologist, particularly because herbal preparations can interact with prescribed medications (e.g., hepatotoxic herbs combined with methotrexate) or delay initiation of effective conventional treatment.
