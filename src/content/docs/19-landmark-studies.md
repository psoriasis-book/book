The pace of psoriasis research has accelerated dramatically. This section highlights the most significant studies published in 2023–2025, explaining why each matters and what new knowledge it introduced.

## 19.1 The 109-Loci GWAS Meta-Analysis (Dand et al., 2025)

**Study:** *Identification of 109 psoriasis susceptibility loci, including 46 novel loci, by multi-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis.* Dand N, et al. Nature Communications. 2025;16:2267.
**Read it:** [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56719-8)

**Why it matters:** This is the largest genetic study of psoriasis ever conducted, analysing 36,466 psoriasis cases and 458,078 controls across 18 genome-wide association studies. It nearly doubled the number of known psoriasis risk loci from ~63 to 109, including 46 entirely novel genetic associations.

**New knowledge:** The study provided genetic proof that the IL-23/IL-17 axis is the central pathogenic pathway in psoriasis — not just a clinical observation, but confirmed at the level of DNA. It also revealed new pathway involvement, including type I interferon signalling, NF-κB regulation, and skin barrier function genes. Perhaps most importantly for patients, it validated the targets of existing biologic therapies at a genetic level, and provided a foundation for future pharmacogenomic approaches that could match patients to the right drug based on their individual genetic profile.

## 19.2 The STEPIn Trial — Early Intervention as Disease Modification (Iversen et al., 2023; Conrad et al., 2023)

**Study:** *Secukinumab demonstrates superiority over narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy in new-onset moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients: Week 52 results from the STEPIn study.* Iversen L, Conrad C, Eidsmo L, et al. JEADV. 2023;37(5):1004–1016.
**Read it:** [JEADV (Wiley)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18846)

**Why it matters:** STEPIn was the first clinical trial ever designed to test whether treating psoriasis aggressively and early — within the first year of disease onset — could modify the long-term course of the disease, rather than just managing symptoms. This is a paradigm shift: the question moved from "how do we control this disease?" to "can we prevent it from becoming chronic in the first place?"

**New knowledge:** At week 52, over 90% of patients treated with secukinumab (an IL-17A inhibitor) achieved PASI 90, dramatically outperforming phototherapy. Even more remarkably, epigenetic analysis of skin biopsies from STEPIn participants showed that patients treated within the first year of disease had their DNA methylation patterns (epigenetic "scarring" that locks cells into an inflammatory state) reversed to normal levels after 12 months of treatment. Patients who had the disease for more than 5 years before treatment still had residual epigenetic scarring even after therapy [(Conrad et al., 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02649-w). This suggests a "window of opportunity" in early psoriasis where aggressive treatment could potentially prevent permanent immune reprogramming of the skin.

The GUIDE trial is now investigating a similar approach using guselkumab (an IL-23 inhibitor) with treatment tapering.

## 19.3 The GUIDE Trial — Super-Responders and Treatment Tapering (Eyerich et al., 2024)

**Study:** *Early disease intervention with guselkumab in psoriasis leads to a higher rate of stable complete skin clearance ('clinical super response').* Eyerich K, et al. JAMA Dermatology. 2024;160(8):953–963.
**Read it:** [JAMA Dermatology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2820951)

**Why it matters:** The GUIDE trial introduced the concept of "clinical super-responders" — patients who achieve complete skin clearance that remains stable even when treatment is reduced or withdrawn. This addresses the critical question: can we eventually stop biologic therapy in some patients?

**New knowledge:** Interim results showed that patients with shorter disease duration (≤2 years) were significantly more likely to achieve and maintain complete skin clearance than patients with longer disease histories. This reinforces the STEPIn findings and supports the hypothesis that early, aggressive treatment may prevent the establishment of tissue-resident memory T cells and epigenetic changes that drive chronic, relapsing disease.

## 19.4 Bimekizumab Phase 3 Trials — Dual IL-17 Blockade (Warren et al., 2021–2023; BE VIVID, BE READY, BE RADIANT, BE BRIGHT)

**Study:** *Bimekizumab versus adalimumab in plaque psoriasis.* Warren RB, et al. N Engl J Med. 2021;385(2):130–141 (BE VIVID). Extended data published through 2023.
**Read it:** [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102388)

**Why it matters:** Bimekizumab was the first biologic to simultaneously block both IL-17A and IL-17F, testing the hypothesis that IL-17F — previously considered less important than IL-17A — also contributes meaningfully to psoriatic inflammation.

**New knowledge:** The BE VIVID and BE READY trials demonstrated that dual IL-17A/F blockade produces among the highest rates of complete skin clearance (PASI 100) of any therapy studied to date, with responses maintained through 3 years in the BE BRIGHT extension study [(Strober et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/). Bimekizumab was FDA-approved in October 2023. Its success confirmed that IL-17F is indeed a non-redundant driver of psoriatic inflammation and that blocking both IL-17 family members provides additional clinical benefit over blocking IL-17A alone.

## 19.5 Cochrane Network Meta-Analysis of Systemic Therapies (Sbidian et al., 2023)

**Study:** *Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis.* Sbidian E, Chaimani A, et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2023;7:CD011535.
**Read it:** [Cochrane Library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011535.pub6/full)

**Why it matters:** This is the gold standard of evidence synthesis — a Cochrane network meta-analysis — and provides the most comprehensive comparison of all systemic psoriasis therapies ever conducted. It is the reference that clinical guidelines worldwide rely on when ranking treatment options.

**New knowledge:** The analysis definitively established the efficacy hierarchy of psoriasis biologics. IL-23 inhibitors (risankizumab, guselkumab) and the dual IL-17 inhibitor bimekizumab ranked at the top for achieving PASI 90. It confirmed that the newer biologics targeting IL-23 and IL-17 are substantially more effective than older TNF-α inhibitors and conventional systemics, while maintaining favourable safety profiles. This evidence has driven the global shift toward IL-23 inhibitors as first-line biologic therapy.

## 19.6 Oral IL-23 Receptor Antagonist — Icotrokinra Phase 3 (ICONIC-LEAD, 2025)

**Study:** *Icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) Phase 3 ICONIC-LEAD trial results.* Presented at AAD Annual Meeting, March 2025.
**Read it:** [Johnson & Johnson press release](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/icotrokinra-results-show-potential-to-set-a-new-standard-of-treatment-in-plaque-psoriasis)

**Why it matters:** Icotrokinra is a first-in-class oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor. If approved, it would be the first pill to offer the efficacy profile of an injectable IL-23 inhibitor — potentially eliminating the need for injections entirely for many patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

**New knowledge:** Phase 3 data showed that nearly half of patients achieved completely clear skin (IGA 0) at week 24 with a once-daily pill. Johnson & Johnson has initiated the first-ever head-to-head trial comparing an oral drug (icotrokinra) against an injectable biologic (ustekinumab), seeking to prove that a pill can match or surpass a biologic injection. This could fundamentally shift how psoriasis is treated, removing a major barrier (injection aversion) that prevents some patients from starting biologic therapy.

## 19.7 Zasocitinib Phase 3 — Next-Generation Oral TYK2 Inhibitor (Takeda, December 2025)

**Study:** *Phase 3 pivotal studies of zasocitinib (TAK-279) in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.* Topline results announced December 2025.
**Read it:** [Takeda press release](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/newsreleases/2025/takeda-zasocitinib-phase-3-plaque-psoriasis-data-once-daily-pill/)

**Why it matters:** Zasocitinib is a next-generation TYK2 inhibitor that is more selective and potent than the first-in-class deucravacitinib (Sotyktu). The Phase 3 results test whether a second-generation oral TYK2 inhibitor can close the efficacy gap between pills and injectable biologics.

**New knowledge:** Both pivotal studies met all primary and all 44 ranked secondary endpoints, including PASI 90 and PASI 100, demonstrating complete skin clearance with a once-daily pill — results that approach injectable biologic-level efficacy. This confirmed that the TYK2 pathway, once considered "undruggable," can be effectively targeted orally, opening the door to an era where high-efficacy psoriasis treatment may no longer require injections.

## 19.8 Biologics Reduce Psoriatic Arthritis Development (Floris et al., 2025)

**Study:** *Treatment of psoriasis with different classes of biologics reduces the likelihood of peripheral and axial psoriatic arthritis development.* Floris A, et al. Rheumatology. 2025;64:1131–1137.
**Read it:** [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/64/3/1131/7691289)

**Why it matters:** Approximately 30% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), often years after skin disease onset. This study is among the first to demonstrate that treating psoriasis with biologics doesn't just clear skin — it may actually prevent the development of joint disease.

**New knowledge:** The study found that patients treated with IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors had a significantly reduced likelihood of developing both peripheral and axial psoriatic arthritis compared to untreated patients or those on conventional therapies. This finding supports the "psoriatic march" hypothesis (Section 10.7) and has major clinical implications: it suggests that early, effective biologic treatment of skin psoriasis may prevent the downstream organ damage that occurs when systemic inflammation is left unchecked.

## 19.9 Hepcidin and Iron Dysregulation — A Novel Pathogenic Mechanism (2024)

**Study:** Reported by ScienceDaily, September 2024.
**Read it:** [ScienceDaily summary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/health_medicine/psoriasis/)

**Why it matters:** Researchers have proposed that hepcidin — a hormone that regulates iron metabolism — when produced abnormally in the skin, may be a root cause of psoriatic inflammation. This is a completely novel angle that falls outside the traditional IL-23/IL-17 paradigm.

**New knowledge:** If confirmed in larger studies, iron dysregulation in the skin could represent an entirely new therapeutic target. This finding reminds us that while the IL-23/Th17 axis is the dominant framework, psoriasis pathogenesis may involve additional mechanisms that current therapies do not address.

## 19.10 Somatic Mutations Ruled Out (2023)

**Study:** *Psoriasis not caused by spontaneous mutations in skin cells.* Published October 2023.
**Read it:** [ScienceDaily summary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/10/231026121930.htm)

**Why it matters:** One longstanding hypothesis was that psoriasis might be driven by somatic mutations (random DNA changes that accumulate in skin cells over a person's lifetime), similar to how cancer develops. If true, this would have fundamentally changed how we understand the disease.

**New knowledge:** Comprehensive genetic analysis showed that somatic mutations are not linked to either the development or the spread of psoriatic plaques. This conclusively rules out a cancer-like mutational model and confirms that psoriasis is driven by immune dysregulation acting on genetically predisposed but otherwise normal skin cells — reinforcing the rationale for immune-targeting therapies.
