## 20.1 Oral IL-23 Pathway Inhibitors

A major area of development is the creation of orally administered IL-23 pathway inhibitors. **Icotrokinra** (formerly JNJ-77242113) is a first-in-class oral peptide that antagonises the IL-23 receptor, potentially combining the high efficacy of IL-23 inhibition with the convenience of oral dosing. Phase 3 data (ICONIC-LEAD) showed that nearly half of patients achieved completely clear skin (IGA 0) at week 24 with a once-daily pill (see Section 19.6 for full trial details). **Zasocitinib**, a next-generation oral TYK2 inhibitor, demonstrated biologic-approaching efficacy in Phase 3 trials (Section 19.7). Together, these agents suggest an era where high-efficacy psoriasis treatment may no longer require injections [(Balogh et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/).

## 20.2 Targeting Immunological Memory

Given the role of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) in psoriasis relapse, there is significant interest in developing therapies that target these memory populations. The STEPIn and GUIDE trials (Sections 19.2–19.3) demonstrated that early, aggressive treatment can reverse the epigenetic reprogramming of psoriatic skin and produce "super-responders" who maintain clearance even when treatment is tapered. Successfully depleting or reprogramming TRM cells could theoretically achieve true disease modification — potentially curing psoriasis rather than merely suppressing active inflammation [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/). Research is ongoing into antibodies that target TRM surface markers (CD103, CD69) and strategies to disrupt the local cytokine signals (IL-15, IL-7) that sustain TRM survival in the skin.

## 20.3 The Microbiome as a Therapeutic Target

Research into the gut-skin axis may yield new therapeutic approaches. Prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation are being investigated for their potential to modulate systemic inflammation in psoriasis. Dietary interventions — particularly Mediterranean, low-calorie, and omega-3-enriched diets — have shown some benefit as adjunctive strategies [(Caso et al., 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541512/). The MEDIPSO trial (Section 12.2) provided the first RCT evidence that a structured Mediterranean diet improves psoriasis independently of weight loss, and further trials investigating specific probiotic strains and dietary fibre supplementation are underway.

## 20.4 Personalised/Precision Medicine

The integration of genetic data (such as HLA-C*06:02 status), transcriptomic profiling of lesional skin, and biomarker-guided treatment selection represents the direction of precision medicine in psoriasis. As genetic risk scores become more refined — the 109-loci GWAS meta-analysis (Section 19.1) provides the most comprehensive foundation to date — they may enable risk prediction for disease onset, disease severity, comorbidity development, and treatment response [(Li et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/pcm/article/2/2/120/5522496). The UK PSORT Consortium has already demonstrated that HLA-C*06:02 status can predict differential response to adalimumab vs ustekinumab (Section 9.7), and similar pharmacogenomic approaches are being developed for the newer IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors.

## 20.5 CAR-T and Engineered Cell Therapies

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, originally developed for haematological malignancies, is now being explored for severe autoimmune diseases. Anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, which comprehensively deplete B lymphocytes, produced sustained drug-free remission in patients with refractory systemic lupus erythematosus, with naive B cell populations reconstituting after approximately 100 days while autoreactive B cell clones did not return [(Mackensen et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36109639/). A subsequent case series of 15 patients with SLE, inflammatory myositis, and systemic sclerosis confirmed these findings, with all participants achieving remission and discontinuing immunosuppressive medications [(Muller et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38381673/).

Direct evidence in psoriasis remains limited but provocative. A 2024 case report described a patient with concurrent chronic plaque psoriasis whose skin lesions completely resolved following CD19 CAR-T cell infusion for lymphoma, suggesting that B-cell depletion may disrupt the immunological circuits sustaining psoriatic inflammation [(Wang et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39534606/). Beyond broad B-cell depletion, researchers are developing more targeted approaches: chimeric autoantigen receptor (CAAR) T cells that eliminate only autoreactive B cells, and regulatory CAR-T cells engineered to suppress rather than kill. Whilst these therapies remain at an early stage, the prospect of achieving lasting drug-free remission through a single cellular infusion represents a paradigm shift in how autoimmune disease might ultimately be managed.

## 20.6 Epigenetic Therapies

Unlike the DNA sequence itself, epigenetic modifications — including DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA expression — are potentially reversible, opening an entirely new avenue for therapeutic intervention. The STEPIn trial demonstrated that early biologic treatment can reverse disease-associated DNA methylation patterns in psoriatic skin (Section 19.2), providing proof of concept that the epigenetic landscape in psoriasis is dynamically responsive to treatment.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are among the most studied epigenetic agents in inflammatory skin disease. Remetinostat, a topical HDAC inhibitor designed for skin-restricted activity, has shown promise in preclinical models: it suppressed dendritic cell maturation, inhibited keratinocyte inflammatory signalling, and reduced IL-17A and IL-22 expression, whilst its metabolically unstable structure ensures rapid systemic inactivation, minimising off-target effects [(Yi & McGee, 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33752257/). Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors represent a complementary strategy: BET proteins read acetylated histone marks and recruit transcriptional machinery, and the BET inhibitor JQ-1 suppressed psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice by modulating the RORC/IL-17A pathway — the same axis targeted by licensed anti-IL-17 biologics [(Nadeem et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26149470/). These approaches suggest that future therapies may move beyond blocking individual cytokines to reprogramming the aberrant transcriptional landscape that sustains chronic inflammation.

## 20.7 Artificial Intelligence in Psoriasis Management

Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform how psoriasis is diagnosed and monitored. The PASI score, long the gold standard for clinical assessment, is notoriously subjective, with substantial inter-rater variability even among experienced dermatologists. Deep learning systems trained on large image databases now demonstrate the ability to match or exceed specialist performance. A system trained on over 14,000 clinical images and deployed as a smartphone application called SkinTeller outperformed the average scoring of 43 experienced dermatologists by 33% in overall PASI estimation, and has been used over 3,300 times across 18 hospitals in real-world clinical practice [(Huang et al., 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36927843/).

Beyond severity assessment, machine learning is being applied to predict treatment response and to differentiate psoriasis from similar conditions. A comprehensive review identified a rapidly expanding landscape of AI applications encompassing lesion detection and segmentation, psoriasis subtype identification, and personalised treatment selection [(Goessinger et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39259262/). However, significant challenges remain: most training datasets lack diversity in skin phototypes (compounding the diagnostic disparities discussed in Section 14.3), imaging protocols are not standardised across centres, and regulatory frameworks for AI-assisted clinical decision-making are still evolving. Nevertheless, the integration of AI tools into routine dermatology practice appears increasingly inevitable and may prove particularly valuable in settings where specialist dermatology access is limited.

## 20.8 The Neuroimmunology of Psoriasis

Psoriatic skin is not merely inflamed — it is hyperinnervated. Compared with healthy skin, psoriatic plaques contain markedly increased densities of sensory nerve fibres, with substance P-positive (SP+) fibres increased approximately sixfold and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive (CGRP+) fibres roughly doubled. This sensory nerve proliferation is driven largely by elevated nerve growth factor (NGF), which both promotes axonal outgrowth and directly sensitises nociceptors, lowering the threshold for itch and pain perception [(Zhang & He, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33133059/).

These neuropeptides are not passive bystanders but active drivers of inflammation. Substance P, acting through the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), promotes vasodilation, mast cell degranulation, and Th17 polarisation. CGRP activates the IL-23/IL-17 axis — the central pathogenic pathway in psoriasis. Together, these neuropeptides establish a bidirectional feedback loop: immune cells release cytokines that sensitise nerve endings and promote further neuropeptide release, which in turn amplifies immune activation. This neuroimmune circuit helps explain several clinical observations, including the well-documented role of psychological stress in triggering flares (Section 7.3), the intense pruritus that many patients experience, and the Koebner phenomenon. Current biologics, whilst highly effective at suppressing cutaneous inflammation, have limited impact on neurological symptoms such as itch and pain, suggesting that the nervous and immune components of psoriasis may require distinct therapeutic approaches.
