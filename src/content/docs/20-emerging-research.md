## 20.1 Oral IL-23 Pathway Inhibitors

A major area of development is the creation of orally administered IL-23 pathway inhibitors. **JNJ-77242113** (now known as icotrokinra) is an investigational oral peptide that antagonises the IL-23 receptor, potentially combining the high efficacy of IL-23 inhibition with the convenience of oral dosing [(Balogh et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11896623/).

## 20.2 Targeting Immunological Memory

Given the role of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) in psoriasis relapse, there is significant interest in developing therapies that target these memory populations. Successfully depleting or reprogramming TRM cells could theoretically achieve true disease modification rather than merely suppressing active inflammation [(Sieminska et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11193704/).

## 20.3 The Microbiome as a Therapeutic Target

Research into the gut-skin axis may yield new therapeutic approaches. Prebiotics, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation are being investigated for their potential to modulate systemic inflammation in psoriasis. Dietary interventions — particularly Mediterranean, low-calorie, and omega-3-enriched diets — have shown some benefit as adjunctive strategies [(Caso et al., 2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541512/).

## 20.4 Personalised/Precision Medicine

The integration of genetic data (such as HLA-C*06:02 status), transcriptomic profiling of lesional skin, and biomarker-guided treatment selection represents the direction of precision medicine in psoriasis. As genetic risk scores become more refined, they may enable risk prediction for disease onset, disease severity, comorbidity development, and treatment response [(Li et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/pcm/article/2/2/120/5522496).
