Many patients with psoriasis explore traditional and complementary medicine systems, either alongside or instead of conventional treatment. This section reviews the most commonly encountered approaches and the available evidence.

## 26.1 Ayurveda

In the Ayurvedic tradition, psoriasis (most closely matching the concept of *Kushtha*) is attributed to an imbalance of *Vata* and *Kapha* doshas, with accumulation of toxins (*Ama*) in the body. Ayurvedic treatments include *Panchakarma* (a five-step detoxification process including therapeutic vomiting, purgation, and enema), herbal preparations (turmeric, neem, guduchi, and aloe vera), and dietary modification. Some small studies from India have reported improvements in PASI scores with Panchakarma, but all have significant methodological limitations: small sample sizes, lack of blinding, absence of placebo controls, and potential for publication bias. No Ayurvedic treatment has been evaluated in a large randomised controlled trial for psoriasis. Turmeric (curcumin) does show anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, but clinical translation remains limited (see Section 19.7).

## 26.2 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

TCM views psoriasis as resulting from *Blood Heat* (血热), *Blood Stasis* (血瘀), or *Blood Dryness* (血燥), with treatment typically involving herbal formulations tailored to the patient's constitutional pattern. Indigo naturalis (青黛, *Qing Dai*), a plant-derived blue powder, has received the most rigorous evaluation of any TCM treatment for psoriasis. A Taiwanese RCT found topical indigo naturalis ointment effective for plaque psoriasis [(Lin et al., 2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17341866/), though it can cause blue skin staining and, when taken orally, has been associated with liver injury and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tripterygium wilfordii (Thunder God Vine) has demonstrated immunosuppressive properties and some efficacy in psoriasis in a systematic review of 20 RCTs, but serious toxicities including hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, and male infertility limit its use [(Lv et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29849698/). Acupuncture has been explored for itch relief and stress reduction; a systematic review of 13 RCTs found some evidence of benefit for acupuncture-related techniques, though the methodological quality of included studies was limited [(Yeh et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628749/).

## 26.3 Dead Sea Climatotherapy and Balneotherapy

The Dead Sea, sitting 430 metres below sea level, has been a psoriasis treatment destination for decades. The combination of high atmospheric pressure (which filters harmful short-wavelength UV), mineral-rich water (containing magnesium, potassium, calcium, and bromide at concentrations 10 times higher than ocean water), and high ambient temperatures creates a unique therapeutic environment. This isn't just folk tradition: there's real clinical evidence behind it.

A systematic review of 27 studies found that Dead Sea climatotherapy (typically 3-4 weeks of graduated sun exposure combined with bathing) produces clinically significant improvement, with PASI 75 achieved in 50-80% of patients depending on programme duration and initial severity [(Harari et al., 2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17214856/). The mechanisms involve UV-B-induced T cell apoptosis (the same principle as hospital phototherapy), mineral absorption through the skin reducing inflammation and scaling, and the psychological benefit of an immersive treatment environment.

**Balneotherapy** (therapeutic bathing) more broadly has been studied in several European spa medicine traditions. A French RCT found that Dead Sea salt baths combined with NB-UVB phototherapy were more effective than NB-UVB alone [(Léauté-Labrèze et al., 2001)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11422160/). Magnesium-rich bathing preparations may improve skin barrier function, and the stress-reduction component of spa therapy likely contributes to benefit.

The practical limitations are obvious: Dead Sea climatotherapy requires travel, time off work, and out-of-pocket expense (most health systems don't fund it), and benefits typically last 3-6 months before a return trip is needed. It's worth knowing about, though, particularly for patients who haven't responded well to conventional approaches or who prefer non-pharmacological options.

**Research stage: Established.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Multiple observational studies and several RCTs; limited by heterogeneous protocols and lack of large-scale blinded trials.

## 26.4 Evidence Summary

No traditional medicine system has produced evidence meeting the standard required for clinical recommendation in international guidelines. That said, some individual compounds (curcumin, indigo naturalis) have biological plausibility and warrant further rigorous investigation. If you're using traditional therapies, tell your dermatologist. Herbal preparations can interact with prescribed medications (e.g., hepatotoxic herbs combined with methotrexate) or delay initiation of effective conventional treatment.
