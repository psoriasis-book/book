Two aspects of quality of life that psoriasis profoundly affects yet clinicians routinely overlook are sleep and sexual health. Both are now supported by substantial epidemiological evidence and share bidirectional relationships with psoriatic inflammation.

## 17.1 Sleep Disturbance and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea

Sleep disturbance is strikingly prevalent in psoriasis. **Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)**, a condition in which the airway repeatedly collapses during sleep causing intermittent oxygen deprivation, appears significantly more common in psoriasis patients. Studies using screening questionnaires report that 36–82% of psoriasis patients are at high risk for OSA [(Ghannam et al., 2025)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12000173/). A 2025 study of 200 psoriasis patients found 54% were at high risk on validated questionnaires. These figures are based on screening tools rather than polysomnography (the gold standard sleep study), so they overestimate confirmed OSA prevalence, but the association is robust even after adjusting for obesity.

The relationship between psoriasis and sleep disturbance is **bidirectional**:

**Psoriasis disrupts sleep** through multiple mechanisms:
- **Pruritus (itch)**: The most direct cause. Psoriatic itch often worsens at night (possibly due to circadian variation in cytokine levels and decreased cortisol), leading to frequent awakenings and fragmented sleep (see Section 18 for itch mechanisms).
- **Pain**: Both cutaneous pain (from fissures, particularly palmoplantar, see Section 11.1) and joint pain from PsA (Section 15) impair sleep quality.
- **Psychological distress**: Anxiety, depression, and body image concerns (Section 16) contribute to insomnia.
- **Medication effects**: Corticosteroids can cause insomnia; methotrexate-related fatigue may disrupt sleep architecture.

**Poor sleep worsens psoriasis** through:
- **Immune dysregulation**: Sleep deprivation elevates IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, the same inflammatory mediators that drive psoriasis. Even partial sleep restriction (6 hours vs 8 hours) measurably increases systemic inflammation [(Hirotsu et al., 2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13555-024-01211-2).
- **Impaired skin barrier function**: Sleep deprivation reduces transepidermal water loss recovery after barrier disruption.
- **Microbiome disruption**: Circadian disruption alters gut microbiome composition, potentially exacerbating the gut-skin axis (Section 6.5).
- **Reduced melatonin**: Melatonin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties; its disruption may remove a protective brake on inflammation.

Now, OSA isn't the only sleep problem. Psoriasis patients also show elevated rates of **insomnia** (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep), **restless leg syndrome** (an urge to move the legs, often with uncomfortable sensations), and **poor sleep quality** as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Even patients with mild psoriasis show increased odds of these sleep disorders, suggesting the relationship isn't driven solely by disease severity.

**Clinical implications**: If you have psoriasis, your clinician should be asking about sleep quality, using validated tools such as the STOP-BANG questionnaire for OSA risk or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Patients at high risk for OSA should be referred for polysomnography. Addressing sleep disorders may improve both quality of life and psoriasis outcomes.

**Research stage: Established.** **Evidence strength: High.** Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses; shared inflammatory mechanisms well-characterised.

## 17.2 Fatigue

Fatigue is one of the most common yet least addressed symptoms in psoriasis. Surveys consistently find that 50-70% of psoriasis patients report clinically significant fatigue, and they rate it among their most burdensome symptoms [(Skoie et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28185242/). This isn't ordinary tiredness. Patients describe a pervasive, disproportionate exhaustion that isn't relieved by rest.

The causes are multifactorial and overlapping:

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, all elevated in psoriasis, directly cause fatigue through effects on the central nervous system. The same "sickness behaviour" that makes you feel exhausted during a flu operates chronically at a lower level in psoriasis.
- **Sleep disruption**: Itch-driven sleep fragmentation, OSA, and insomnia (Section 17.1) directly cause daytime fatigue.
- **Depression**: Fatigue is a core symptom of major depression (Section 16.1), which affects 12-19% of psoriasis patients.
- **Anaemia of chronic disease**: Chronic inflammation can suppress erythropoiesis and iron availability.
- **Metabolic comorbidities**: Obesity, insulin resistance, and hypothyroidism (all more common in psoriasis) contribute to fatigue.
- **Medication effects**: Methotrexate causes fatigue in a significant proportion of patients, typically worst 24-48 hours after the weekly dose.

Biologic therapy can improve fatigue. A pooled analysis of clinical trial data found that patients achieving PASI 90 on IL-17 inhibitors reported significantly less fatigue than partial responders, suggesting that controlling inflammation helps [(Strand et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30552176/). But fatigue often persists even after skin clearance, pointing to the central sensitisation and sleep architecture disruption discussed elsewhere in this chapter.

If you experience persistent fatigue, it's worth discussing with your clinician. Screening for anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, and depression can identify treatable contributors.

**Research stage: Established.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Cross-sectional studies and clinical trial secondary endpoints; multifactorial aetiology well-described.

## 17.3 Sexual Dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction is reported by approximately **40.8% of psoriasis patients overall**, with prevalence reaching 68% in women in some studies. Despite its high prevalence, it remains one of the least-discussed aspects of the disease in clinical practice [(Zhang et al., 2024)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1339196/full).

**Erectile dysfunction (ED)** affects approximately 52.9% of male psoriasis patients compared with 40.3% of age-matched controls. The mechanisms are multifactorial:

- **Psychological**: Shame, body image distress, and fear of rejection significantly impair sexual desire and arousal. In a survey of male psoriasis patients, 44.7% reported experiencing rejection by a sexual partner due to their skin disease.
- **Hormonal**: Psoriasis is associated with decreased total and free testosterone and increased estradiol levels, which may reflect chronic inflammation-mediated disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
- **Vascular/inflammatory**: The same endothelial dysfunction that increases cardiovascular risk (Section 14.2) also impairs penile blood flow. TNF-α, IL-17, and CRP are elevated in psoriasis patients with ED compared with those without.
- **Genital involvement**: Direct involvement of genital skin (Section 11.3) causes pain, irritation, and dyspareunia (painful intercourse), which may affect up to 63% of patients at some point.

**Female sexual dysfunction** is less well-studied but includes reduced desire, arousal difficulty, dyspareunia, and orgasmic dysfunction. Vulvar psoriasis may cause pain, burning, and itching that directly interfere with sexual activity.

**Research stage: Established.** **Evidence strength: Moderate-High.** Systematic reviews and large cross-sectional studies; multifactorial mechanisms well-described.

## 17.4 Fertility and Reproductive Health

Emerging evidence indicates that untreated psoriasis impairs **male fertility** through mechanisms beyond sexual dysfunction:

- **Spermatogenesis**: Systemic inflammation decreases sperm count and motility. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) directly damage the testicular microenvironment and disrupt the blood-testis barrier.
- **Sexual accessory gland inflammation**: Seminal vesicles and prostate may be affected by systemic inflammation, altering seminal fluid composition.
- **Hormonal disruption**: Reduced testosterone impairs spermatogenesis (see above).

A 2024 study demonstrated that treatment with **adalimumab** produced significant improvements not only in erectile function but also in sperm motility, vitality, and serum testosterone levels, suggesting that inflammation control directly benefits male fertility [(Hahn et al., 2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00403-024-03520-0).

**Medication effects on fertility** must also be considered:
- **Methotrexate**: A folate antagonist that can impair spermatogenesis at high doses. The 2024 EULAR update on antirheumatic drugs in reproduction now considers methotrexate at standard therapeutic doses (up to 25 mg/week) compatible with paternal conception without a mandatory washout period, based on evidence showing no adverse effects on sperm DNA or birth outcomes. Some national guidelines (including BAD) have not yet updated their recommendations, so discuss this with your prescriber.
- **Acitretin**: Teratogenic; women must avoid pregnancy for 3 years after discontinuation due to tissue storage and re-esterification. For men, the evidence does not clearly demonstrate teratogenic risk from paternal exposure, though traces are found in semen.
- **Sulfasalazine**: Can cause reversible oligospermia.
- **Biologics**: Current evidence suggests IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors don't adversely affect male fertility, and may improve it by reducing inflammation (see above).

For a detailed discussion of psoriasis management during pregnancy, see Section 21.1.

**Research stage: Emerging.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Small RCTs and observational studies with biologically plausible mechanisms. Larger prospective studies needed.
