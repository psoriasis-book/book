Psoriasis patients frequently seek complementary and alternative approaches, either alongside or instead of conventional treatment. Given the chronic nature of the disease, it is understandable that people want to explore every option. However, the quality of evidence for most lifestyle interventions varies enormously — from well-powered randomised controlled trials to anecdotal reports. This section summarises the current state of the science.

## 12.1 Weight Loss — Strong Evidence

Weight loss is the lifestyle intervention with the strongest evidence base in psoriasis. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (1,145 participants) published in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology found that weight-loss interventions produced a mean PASI reduction of 2.5 points more than controls (95% CI: −3.8 to −1.1), and that participants who lost weight were 1.6 times more likely to achieve PASI 75 [(Morrow et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41416383/). The meta-analysis included dietary interventions, exercise programmes, and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (the class of drugs that includes semaglutide/Ozempic). The authors concluded with "high-certainty evidence" that weight-loss interventions improve both psoriasis severity and quality of life. A separate long-term follow-up study found that these benefits persist: patients who maintained weight loss for 64 weeks continued to show reduced psoriasis severity [(Jensen et al., 2016)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27334236/).

The biological rationale is well-established: adipose tissue (body fat) produces pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6, which feed into the same inflammatory pathways that drive psoriasis. Additionally, obesity reduces the efficacy of biologic therapies — particularly fixed-dose regimens, where patients above 100 kg are less likely to achieve optimal responses — meaning that weight loss can improve treatment response [(Puig, 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492252/).

**Evidence grade: High. Recommended as adjunct therapy by clinical guidelines.**

## 12.2 Mediterranean Diet — Moderate Evidence (Growing)

The Mediterranean diet — rich in olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, and low in processed food and red meat — has shown promising results. The first randomised clinical trial specifically evaluating a structured Mediterranean diet programme for psoriasis (the MEDIPSO trial, 2025) found that a 16-week dietitian-guided Mediterranean diet intervention produced a 3.4-point greater PASI reduction than a standard low-fat diet — and this improvement was independent of weight loss [(Perez-Bootello et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40991259/). The intervention group also showed improvements in HbA1c (a marker of blood sugar control) and anxiety.

Prior to this trial, evidence came mainly from observational studies, including a large French survey of 35,735 patients that found an association between severe psoriasis and low adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Mediterranean diet (particularly omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and fibre) provide a plausible biological mechanism.

**Evidence grade: Moderate, with the first RCT published in 2025. Promising but more trials needed.**

## 12.3 Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil) — Mixed Evidence

Fish oil supplementation has been studied multiple times with contradictory results. An 8-week double-blind study of 28 patients found significant improvement in itching, redness, and scaling — but not in the size of patches [(Bittiner et al., 1988)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2893189/). However, a larger double-blind study of 145 patients over 4 months found no benefit compared to placebo [(Soyland et al., 1993)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8502270/). A 2025 systematic review concluded that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation "may be associated with improved psoriasis outcomes" but that evidence quality remains low [(Li et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026156142500041X).

**Evidence grade: Low to moderate. Conflicting trial results. May have modest benefit as adjunct therapy but is not a standalone treatment.**

## 12.4 Gluten-Free Diet — Conditional Evidence

A gluten-free diet has been shown to benefit a specific subgroup of psoriasis patients: those who test positive for antigliadin antibodies (a marker of gluten sensitivity). In one study, 73% of antibody-positive patients saw significant PASI improvement after 3 months on a gluten-free diet, while none of the antibody-negative patients improved [(Michaëlsson et al., 2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10651693/). A 2018 study by Kolchak et al. found 56% and 36% PASI improvement in patients with very high and high antigliadin antibody levels respectively after one year on a gluten-free diet [(Kolchak et al., 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29343966/).

However, for psoriasis patients without gluten sensitivity, the available evidence shows no benefit from a gluten-free diet. Screening psoriasis patients for coeliac disease markers may identify the subset who could benefit.

**Evidence grade: Moderate for antigliadin-positive patients. No evidence of benefit for patients without gluten sensitivity.**

## 12.5 Probiotics and the Gut Microbiome — Emerging but Early

Given the emerging research on the gut-skin axis (discussed in Section 6.5), probiotics and prebiotics are attracting interest. A 2025 systematic review found that probiotic and prebiotic supplementation "may be associated with improved psoriasis outcomes," but the number of clinical trials is small and their methodologies are heterogeneous [(Li et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026156142500041X). This area is biologically plausible but requires substantially more clinical data before recommendations can be made.

**Evidence grade: Very low. Biologically plausible but insufficient clinical trial data.**

## 12.6 Topical Herbal and Natural Remedies

A 2025 systematic review published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine evaluated herbal medicines for psoriasis using PRISMA guidelines and found that three natural remedies have the strongest clinical evidence [(Anheyer et al., 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229925000482):

- **Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape)**: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 200 people found that 10% Oregon grape cream produced statistically significant improvement over placebo over 3 months, though it was less effective than standard topical medications.
- **Indigo naturalis** (a traditional Chinese herbal preparation): Several studies have shown efficacy in psoriasis, with active compounds including indirubin, which has been demonstrated to inhibit the JAK3/STAT3 pathway and suppress IL-17A production in laboratory studies.
- **Aloe vera**: A double-blind study of 60 patients found that 0.5% aloe vera cream produced significantly better results than placebo over 4 weeks. However, a follow-up replication study of 40 patients failed to confirm this finding. A 2023 review noted that aloe vera reduced mean PASI scores by 7.7 points in the treatment group.

Other natural remedies commonly discussed include:
- **Curcumin (turmeric)**: Has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory studies, including the ability to modulate TNF-α expression. However, clinical trial data in psoriasis is limited to small studies.
- **Tea tree oil**: No scientific studies have proven effectiveness in psoriasis despite anecdotal reports.
- **Apple cider vinegar**: No clinical evidence of efficacy; can cause skin damage if applied to cracked or broken skin.
- **Colloidal oatmeal baths / Dead Sea salts**: May provide symptomatic relief (itching, scaling) but no evidence of disease modification.

**Evidence grade: Low to moderate for Oregon grape and indigo naturalis; low for aloe vera; very low or no evidence for tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and others.**

## 12.7 Stress Reduction

Stress is a well-documented trigger for psoriasis flares (Section 7.3), and several small studies have explored whether stress-reduction interventions can improve outcomes. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) combined with phototherapy has shown faster skin clearance than phototherapy alone in one small study. However, the evidence base remains limited to small trials and no clinical guideline currently recommends specific stress-reduction protocols for psoriasis management.

**Evidence grade: Low. Biologically plausible but inadequately studied.**

## 12.8 Alcohol and Smoking Cessation

As discussed in Sections 7.4 and 7.5, smoking and alcohol are established risk factors for psoriasis onset, severity, and treatment resistance. While no RCT has directly tested smoking cessation as a psoriasis intervention (for obvious ethical and practical reasons), observational evidence consistently shows that smokers have worse psoriasis outcomes. Smoking cessation and alcohol reduction are recommended by clinical guidelines for all psoriasis patients, both for skin disease and for the associated cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.

**Evidence grade: High (observational). Recommended by clinical guidelines.**

## 12.9 Summary: The Evidence Hierarchy

| Intervention | Evidence Grade | Best Evidence | Recommended? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weight loss | **High** | Multiple RCTs, meta-analyses | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Smoking cessation | **High (observational)** | Consistent observational data | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Alcohol reduction | **Moderate (observational)** | Observational studies | Yes — clinical guideline recommendation |
| Mediterranean diet | **Moderate** | 1 RCT (2025) + observational data | Promising — more RCTs needed |
| Gluten-free diet | **Moderate (conditional)** | Small trials in antibody-positive patients | Only if antigliadin antibody-positive |
| Fish oil / omega-3 | **Low–moderate** | Conflicting RCTs | May help as adjunct; not standalone |
| Oregon grape cream | **Low–moderate** | 1 RCT of 200 patients | May help for mild disease |
| Indigo naturalis | **Low–moderate** | Several studies; preclinical mechanism data | May help; more data needed |
| Aloe vera | **Low** | Conflicting trial results | Insufficient evidence |
| Curcumin/turmeric | **Low** | Preclinical + small clinical studies | Insufficient evidence |
| Probiotics | **Very low** | Preliminary only | Insufficient evidence |
| Tea tree oil | **None** | No clinical studies | No evidence |
| Apple cider vinegar | **None** | No clinical studies | No evidence; may cause harm |

> **Important:** None of these lifestyle interventions are a substitute for medical treatment in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation advises patients to discuss any complementary approaches with their dermatologist before use, particularly herbal remedies that may interact with prescribed medications.
