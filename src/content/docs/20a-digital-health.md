The convergence of telemedicine platforms, smartphone applications, and artificial intelligence is creating new models for psoriasis management that extend care beyond the traditional clinic visit. The COVID-19 pandemic (Section 21) accelerated adoption of remote care, and emerging evidence suggests these approaches may become permanent features of dermatological practice.

## 20a.1 Teledermatology for Psoriasis

The **International Psoriasis Council (IPC)** has endorsed remote monitoring as a feasible alternative to in-person visits for established psoriasis patients, and the **National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF)** published 22 consensus statements on telemedicine in psoriasis management [(JMIR, 2025)](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e73664).

Two models of teledermatology are in use:

- **Store-and-forward (asynchronous)**: Patients submit photographs and clinical information through a secure platform; a dermatologist reviews and responds within hours to days. This model is efficient for routine monitoring of stable disease and medication refills.
- **Live video (synchronous)**: Real-time consultations via video link. Preferred for initial assessments, treatment decisions, and patient education.

**Evidence for effectiveness** is nuanced:
- **Specialist-led remote care** is effective: studies demonstrate comparable clinical outcomes (PASI improvement, DLQI change) between teledermatology and face-to-face consultations for established psoriasis patients on stable therapy.
- **Primary care-led remote management** shows non-significant outcomes, highlighting the importance of specialist expertise in interpreting clinical images and making treatment decisions [(Frontiers in Digital Health, 2025)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1656585/full).

**Limitations** include difficulty assessing palpable features (induration, tenderness), challenges with image quality and standardisation, potential for missed diagnoses (particularly in darker skin phototypes where erythema is less visible in photographs — Section 14.3), and digital literacy barriers in older or socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

**Research stage: Established.** **Evidence strength: Moderate-High.** Consensus guidelines published; RCTs supporting specialist-led remote care.

## 20a.2 Mobile Health Applications

A growing ecosystem of smartphone apps supports psoriasis self-management:

- **Symptom tracking**: Apps that allow patients to photograph lesions over time, track PASI or BSA, and record flare triggers. Longitudinal self-monitoring data can inform clinical decisions and empower patients to identify personal trigger patterns.
- **Education and community**: Platforms connecting patients with evidence-based information and peer support networks (complementing the organisations listed in Section 22a).
- **Treatment adherence**: Medication reminder apps that prompt topical application or injection scheduling. Given that non-adherence to topical therapy is one of the primary drivers of treatment failure (Section 15a), these tools address a significant clinical challenge.

**Psorcast** is a notable research application developed to collect real-world data on psoriasis and PsA. It uses smartphone sensors and patient-reported outcomes to predict PsA flares and assess medication efficacy in real-world settings.

**Limitations** include variable app quality, lack of regulatory oversight (most health apps are not classified as medical devices), privacy concerns regarding health data, and the "digital divide" — patients most in need of support may have least access to smartphone technology.

**Research stage: Emerging.** **Evidence strength: Low-Moderate.** Pilot studies and feasibility trials; few RCTs comparing app-based interventions with standard care.

## 20a.3 AI-Integrated Diagnostics

Section 20.7 describes the application of AI to PASI scoring and lesion detection. In the context of digital health, AI integration extends to **point-of-care diagnostic tools**:

- An **EfficientNet-B4** deep learning model achieved 92.3% accuracy in differentiating psoriasis from other papulosquamous disorders (seborrhoeic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, lichen planus) using dermoscopic images, outperforming several non-specialist dermatologists.
- AI-powered tools integrated into teledermatology platforms could enable automated severity scoring, reducing inter-rater variability and increasing consistency of remote assessments.
- **Subtype identification**: Machine learning models are being trained to distinguish between psoriasis subtypes (plaque, guttate, pustular) from clinical photographs, which could support diagnostic accuracy in primary care settings.

**Critical challenges** remain:
- **Skin phototype diversity**: Most training datasets are dominated by images of lighter skin, potentially reducing accuracy in darker skin phototypes and exacerbating existing diagnostic disparities (Section 14.3).
- **Standardisation**: Inconsistent imaging protocols (lighting, resolution, distance) across clinical settings reduce model reliability.
- **Regulatory frameworks**: AI-assisted clinical decision-making tools face evolving regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction.

**Research stage: Emerging.** **Evidence strength: Moderate.** Validation studies with strong accuracy metrics; real-world deployment limited; diversity and standardisation remain barriers.

## 20a.4 Remote Monitoring and Treatment Optimisation

Looking further ahead, digital health may enable **continuous, passive monitoring** of psoriasis:

- **Wearable devices**: Sensors measuring skin temperature, moisture, and scratching behaviour (accelerometry) could detect subclinical flares before they become visible, enabling pre-emptive treatment adjustment.
- **Patient-reported outcome (PRO) platforms**: Structured digital collection of DLQI, itch VAS (visual analogue scale), and pain scores between clinic visits, feeding directly into electronic health records.
- **Biologic dosing optimisation**: Integration of remote severity data with pharmacokinetic modelling could support personalised dosing intervals — for example, extending IL-23 inhibitor dosing in patients maintaining PASI 0 or reducing intervals in patients showing early signs of relapse.

These approaches are conceptual or in early pilot stages, but they represent the trajectory of psoriasis care: from episodic, clinic-based assessment to continuous, data-driven management.

**Research stage: Experimental.** **Evidence strength: Low.** Concept papers and pilot feasibility studies; no established clinical protocols.
