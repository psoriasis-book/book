## About This Book

**Author:** Miko Pawlikowski
**Date:** February 2026

I'm not a doctor. I'm a software engineer with psoriasis who wanted a single, rigorous guide to the science behind the disease. This book synthesises the current state of psoriasis research into something comprehensive and honest. Every claim is cited, every mechanism explained. It's free to read at [psoriasis.fyi](https://psoriasis.fyi).
