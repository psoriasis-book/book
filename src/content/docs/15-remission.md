A question frequently asked by newly diagnosed patients is: *can psoriasis go away completely?* The answer is nuanced.

## 15.1 What Is "Remission" in Psoriasis?

There has historically been no standardised definition of remission in psoriasis. A 2022 systematic literature review by the National Psoriasis Foundation identified 41 different definitions of "remission" across 106 studies, ranging from PASI 75 to complete skin clearance [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/). In 2025, the National Psoriasis Foundation published a consensus statement defining "on-treatment remission" as maintaining ≤1% body surface area involvement for at least 6 months, with a DLQI score of 0 or 1 (indicating no impact on quality of life) [(NPF, 2025)](https://www.psoriasis.org/watch-and-listen/defining-on-treatment-remission-abbvie/). Crucially, this definition specifies *on-treatment* remission — it explicitly acknowledges that most patients achieve clearance while continuing medication.

True **drug-free remission** — complete skin clearance sustained for at least 12 months without any therapy — is much rarer and has only been addressed in one small consensus initiative [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/).

## 15.2 Guttate Psoriasis: The Strongest Case for Spontaneous Remission

Guttate psoriasis — the form characterised by sudden eruptions of small, droplet-shaped lesions, often following a streptococcal throat infection — has the best-documented potential for spontaneous resolution. Guttate psoriasis typically follows a predictable course: new lesions develop during the first month, stabilise in the second month, and begin to remit in the third month.

Key findings from the literature:

- A 2023 systematic review reported that guttate psoriasis generally spontaneously remits within 12–16 weeks of onset [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11619194/).
- A retrospective study of 36 patients found that 61.1% achieved complete remission lasting at least 1 year (designated "good prognosis"), while 38.9% had incomplete remission or progressed to chronic plaque psoriasis [(Ko et al., 2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20860740/).
- A larger, long-term follow-up study of 120 patients with new-onset guttate psoriasis (mean follow-up 6.2 years) found that 50.9% achieved complete remission, while 49.1% had persistent psoriatic disease. Of those with persistent disease, 17.5% had switched to the plaque psoriasis phenotype [(Guttman-Yassky et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10015744/).
- Factors associated with *better* prognosis (more likely to fully remit): younger age at onset, preceding streptococcal infection with high ASO titres, and absence of family history of plaque psoriasis.
- Factors associated with *worse* prognosis (more likely to persist): family history of chronic plaque psoriasis, multiple flares (>3), scalp involvement, palmoplantar involvement, and male sex.

In summary: approximately half to two-thirds of first-episode guttate psoriasis patients achieve spontaneous complete remission, documented in peer-reviewed follow-up studies. However, about one-third to one-half go on to develop chronic psoriasis.

## 15.3 Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: Spontaneous Remission Is Rare

For chronic plaque psoriasis — the most common form (80–90% of cases) — spontaneous drug-free remission is uncommon. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of worsening (flares) and improvement, but complete spontaneous clearance without treatment is considered exceptional. When it does occur, it is typically temporary: the American Academy of Dermatology notes that most remission periods last 1–12 months, and data shows that 41% of patients who achieve remission restart medication within one year, rising to 86% within five years [(WebMD, 2025)](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/features/psoriasis-remission-what-to-expect).

The biological explanation for this is the persistence of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) discussed in Section 7.4 — even after visible plaques clear, the immunological "memory" of disease remains embedded in the skin, ready to reinitiate inflammation upon provocation.

## 15.4 On-Treatment Complete Clearance: Increasingly Achievable

While drug-free remission remains elusive for chronic plaque psoriasis, *on-treatment* complete clearance (PASI 100) has become an increasingly realistic goal with modern biologics. The most effective IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. risankizumab) achieve PASI 100 in approximately 40–55% of patients, and newer agents like bimekizumab achieve even higher rates. PASI 90 (near-complete clearance) is achieved in 60–80% of patients on modern biologics. The 2025 consensus statement from dermatologists reflects this shift: the treatment goal has moved from PASI 75 (historically considered "success") to PASI 100, recognising that complete clearance represents deeper suppression of the underlying systemic inflammation and may reduce the risk of psoriatic arthritis [(HCPLive, 2026)](https://www.hcplive.com/view/redefining-treatment-success-and-remission-in-psoriasis-care).
