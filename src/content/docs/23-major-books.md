## 23.2 Patient-Oriented and Alternative Approach Books

---

**Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative**
*Author: John O.A. Pagano D.C.*
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, 2009 (revised edition) | ISBN: 978-0-470-26726-3

The best-known patient-oriented book on psoriasis, originally published in 1991 and now in a revised edition. Pagano's central thesis is that psoriasis originates in the intestines ("leaky gut") and can be managed through dietary modification, detoxification, and spinal adjustments. The book outlines an elimination diet, herbal teas, and lifestyle changes. It remains hugely popular with patients, with a companion cookbook also available (*Dr. John's Healing Psoriasis Cookbook*).

**About the author:** John O.A. Pagano (1929–2012) was a chiropractic physician based in New Jersey who spent over 40 years developing his dietary approach to psoriasis. His work is not considered evidence-based by mainstream dermatology, and his "leaky gut" hypothesis, while now partially supported by emerging microbiome research (Section 7.5), has never been validated in controlled clinical trials. Nevertheless, many patients report subjective benefit from his dietary recommendations, and the book has been translated into multiple languages.

**WARNING: Note:** This book should be read critically. While some dietary principles overlap with evidence-supported recommendations (reducing processed food, increasing fibre), other claims lack scientific support, and the book should not be used as a substitute for medical treatment.

**The Psoriasis Cure: A Drug-Free Guide to Stopping and Reversing the Symptoms of Psoriasis**
*Author: Lisa LeVan*
Publisher: Avery, 2000 | ISBN: 978-0-89529-983-5

A patient guide emphasising dietary and lifestyle interventions, nutritional supplementation, and stress management. Covers fish oil, antioxidant vitamins, herbal remedies, and elimination diets. Written in accessible language for newly diagnosed patients.

**About the author:** Lisa LeVan is a health writer and patient advocate who was diagnosed with psoriasis herself. The book reflects the patient experience but, like the Pagano book, its dietary and supplement recommendations are not supported by robust clinical trial evidence. It should be read as a patient perspective rather than a clinical guide.

**WARNING: Note:** The title's promise of a "cure" is misleading — there is no cure for psoriasis. Some dietary recommendations overlap with emerging evidence (omega-3 fatty acids, anti-inflammatory diets) but others are unsubstantiated.

---

**Psoriasis: Causes, Diagnosis and Therapies**
*Editor: Emily Howling*
Publisher: Foster Academics, 2016 | ISBN: 978-1-63241-435-9

An edited academic volume covering research on psoriasis causes, diagnosis, and treatment. Discusses both established knowledge and recent research directions in immunology and genetics. Aimed at students and professionals in dermatology and medical genetics.

## 23.3 General Dermatology References with Major Psoriasis Coverage

---

**Rook's Textbook of Dermatology (9th Edition)**
*Editors: Christopher E.M. Griffiths, Jonathan Barker, Tanya Bleiker, Robert Chalmers, Daniel Creamer*
Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell, 2016 | ISBN: 978-1-118-44117-6

The gold-standard general dermatology textbook, with a comprehensive multi-chapter section on psoriasis covering epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment. Chapter 20 (Psoriasis) by Griffiths and Barker is one of the most authoritative single-chapter reviews of the disease available. Essential reference for any dermatology trainee.

**About the editors:** The same Griffiths and Barker team that edited the *Textbook of Psoriasis* (above), ensuring the psoriasis content reflects the leading expertise in the field.

---

**Treatment of Skin Disease: Comprehensive Therapeutic Strategies (6th Edition)**
*Editors: Mark G. Lebwohl, Warren R. Heymann, Ian Coulson, John Berth-Jones*
Publisher: Elsevier, 2022 | ISBN: 978-0-7020-8221-5

A practical treatment-focused reference covering over 270 dermatological conditions. The psoriasis sections provide evidence-ranked therapeutic algorithms (first-line, second-line, third-line) for each clinical subtype, including plaque, guttate, pustular, inverse, nail, and erythrodermic psoriasis. Invaluable for clinical decision-making.

**About the editors:** Mark Lebwohl (see above) and Warren Heymann are both internationally recognised for psoriasis expertise. The multi-edition success of this book reflects its practical utility in daily clinical practice.

---

**Fitzpatrick's Dermatology (9th Edition, 2 Volumes)**
*Editors: Sewon Kang, Masayuki Amagai, Anna L. Bruckner, Alexander H. Enk, David J. Margolis, Amy J. McMichael, Jeffrey S. Orringer*
Publisher: McGraw-Hill, 2019 | ISBN: 978-0-07-183778-1

The most comprehensive general dermatology reference in the English language (over 3,500 pages across two volumes). Contains extensive multi-chapter coverage of psoriasis including pathophysiology, clinical variants, comorbidities, and the full therapeutic spectrum from topicals to biologics. A cornerstone reference for any academic dermatology department.

**About the work:** Originally created by Thomas B. Fitzpatrick, the founder of modern academic dermatology at Harvard, and now in its 9th edition with editors from leading institutions worldwide.

---

> **Note for future review:** The clinical textbooks (Griffiths/Barker, Lebwohl/Koo, Menter/Ryan, Bhutani) contain the most reliable and up-to-date scientific information. The patient-oriented books (Pagano, LeVan) are popular but should be evaluated critically against the evidence presented in this paper, particularly Sections 9 (Lifestyle and Diet) and 7 (Immunopathogenesis). Several of these books — particularly the older editions — predate the biologic therapy revolution and the IL-23/Th17 paradigm shift; readers should supplement them with recent primary literature.
