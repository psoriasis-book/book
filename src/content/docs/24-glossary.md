| **Guttate psoriasis** | A form characterised by small, droplet-shaped lesions; often triggered by streptococcal infection |
| **HDAC (Histone Deacetylase)** | An enzyme that removes acetyl groups from histones; HDAC inhibitors are drugs that block this activity to modulate gene expression in inflammatory diseases |
