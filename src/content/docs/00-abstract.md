Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated (caused by the body's own immune system) inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 125 million people worldwide. Once considered a simple disorder of skin cell overgrowth, it is now understood as a complex systemic disease (one that affects the whole body, not just the skin) driven by dysregulated (improperly controlled) immune responses, genetic susceptibility, and environmental triggers. This paper synthesises the current state of scientific knowledge on psoriasis, drawing on peer-reviewed literature spanning immunology, genetics, epidemiology (the study of disease patterns in populations), and therapeutics. We present the molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis (how the disease develops and progresses) — including the central IL-23/IL-17 axis (a chain of immune signalling molecules that drives the disease; explained fully in Section 6) — in terms accessible to readers without prior immunology training. We also review the genetic architecture of psoriasis susceptibility, environmental risk factors, associated comorbidities, and the revolution in targeted biologic therapies that has transformed patient outcomes over the past two decades.
