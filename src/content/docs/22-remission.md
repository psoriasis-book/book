A question frequently asked by newly diagnosed patients is: *can psoriasis go away completely?* The answer is nuanced.

## 22.1 What Is "Remission" in Psoriasis?

There has historically been no standardised definition of remission in psoriasis. A 2022 systematic literature review by the National Psoriasis Foundation identified 41 different definitions of "remission" across 106 studies, ranging from PASI 75 to complete skin clearance [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/). In 2025, the National Psoriasis Foundation published a consensus statement defining "on-treatment remission" as maintaining complete clearance (BSA 0% or IGA 0) for at least 6 months while receiving treatment [(Armstrong et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40531503/). Crucially, this definition specifies *on-treatment* remission — it explicitly acknowledges that most patients achieve clearance while continuing medication.

True **drug-free remission** — complete skin clearance sustained for at least 12 months without any therapy — is much rarer and has only been addressed in one small consensus initiative [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/).

## 22.2 Guttate Psoriasis: The Strongest Case for Spontaneous Remission

Guttate psoriasis — the form characterised by sudden eruptions of small, droplet-shaped lesions, often following a streptococcal throat infection — has the best-documented potential for spontaneous resolution. Guttate psoriasis typically follows a predictable course: new lesions develop during the first month, stabilise in the second month, and begin to remit in the third month.

Key findings from the literature:

- A systematic review reported that guttate psoriasis generally spontaneously remits within 12–16 weeks of onset [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11619194/).
- A retrospective study of 36 patients found that 61.1% achieved complete remission lasting at least 1 year (designated "good prognosis"), while 38.9% had incomplete remission or progressed to chronic plaque psoriasis [(Ko et al., 2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20860740/).
- A larger, long-term follow-up study of 120 patients with new-onset guttate psoriasis (mean follow-up 6.2 years) found that 50.9% achieved complete remission, while 49.1% had persistent psoriatic disease. Of those with persistent disease, 17.5% had switched to the plaque psoriasis phenotype [(Galili et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10015744/).
- Factors associated with *better* prognosis (more likely to fully remit): younger age at onset, preceding streptococcal infection with high ASO titres, and absence of family history of plaque psoriasis.
- Factors associated with *worse* prognosis (more likely to persist): family history of chronic plaque psoriasis, multiple flares (>3), scalp involvement, palmoplantar involvement, and male sex.

In summary: approximately half to two-thirds of first-episode guttate psoriasis patients achieve spontaneous complete remission, documented in peer-reviewed follow-up studies. However, about one-third to one-half go on to develop chronic psoriasis.

## 22.3 Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: Spontaneous Remission Is Rare

For chronic plaque psoriasis — the most common form (80–90% of cases) — spontaneous drug-free remission is uncommon. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of worsening (flares) and improvement, but complete spontaneous clearance without treatment is considered exceptional. When it does occur, it is typically temporary: most remission periods last 1–12 months. In clinical trial populations treated with biologics or tofacitinib, data shows that 42% of patients who achieve remission restart medication within one year, rising to 86% within five years [(Huang & Tsai, 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31270683/). A Danish nationwide cohort study found that among patients who achieved complete clearance (PASI 0) at biologic discontinuation, 50% remained in remission or managed with topical therapy alone for at least 2 years [(Nielsen et al., 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36739903/).

The biological explanation for this is the persistence of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) discussed in Section 6.4 — even after visible plaques clear, the immunological "memory" of disease remains embedded in the skin, ready to reinitiate inflammation upon provocation.

## 22.4 On-Treatment Complete Clearance: Increasingly Achievable

While drug-free remission remains elusive for chronic plaque psoriasis, *on-treatment* complete clearance (PASI 100) has become an increasingly realistic goal with modern biologics. The most effective IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. risankizumab) achieve PASI 100 in approximately 40–55% of patients, and newer agents like bimekizumab achieve even higher rates. PASI 90 (near-complete clearance) is achieved in 60–80% of patients on modern biologics. The 2025 NPF consensus statement reflects this shift: on-treatment remission is now defined as sustained complete clearance (BSA 0% or IGA 0) for at least 6 months — a standard far beyond the historical PASI 75 benchmark, recognising that complete clearance represents deeper suppression of the underlying systemic inflammation and may reduce the risk of psoriatic arthritis [(Armstrong et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40531503/).
