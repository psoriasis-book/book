A question frequently asked by newly diagnosed patients is: *can psoriasis go away completely?* The answer is nuanced.

## 22.1 What Is "Remission" in Psoriasis?

There has historically been no standardised definition of remission in psoriasis. A 2022 systematic literature review by the National Psoriasis Foundation identified 41 different definitions of "remission" across 106 studies, ranging from PASI 75 to complete skin clearance [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/). In 2025, the National Psoriasis Foundation published a consensus statement defining "on-treatment remission" as maintaining complete clearance (BSA 0% or IGA 0) for at least 6 months while receiving treatment [(Armstrong et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40531503/). This definition specifies *on-treatment* remission. It explicitly acknowledges that most patients achieve clearance while continuing medication.

True **drug-free remission**, complete skin clearance sustained for at least 12 months without any therapy, is much rarer and has only been addressed in one small consensus initiative [(Balak et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35924437/).

## 22.2 Guttate Psoriasis: The Strongest Case for Spontaneous Remission

Guttate psoriasis, the form characterised by sudden eruptions of small, droplet-shaped lesions often following a streptococcal throat infection, has the best-documented potential for spontaneous resolution. It typically follows a predictable course: new lesions develop during the first month, stabilise in the second month, and begin to remit in the third month.

Key findings from the literature:

- A systematic review reported that guttate psoriasis generally spontaneously remits within 12–16 weeks of onset [(Zhou et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11619194/).
- A retrospective study of 36 patients found that 61.1% achieved complete remission lasting at least 1 year (designated "good prognosis"), while 38.9% had incomplete remission or progressed to chronic plaque psoriasis [(Ko et al., 2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20860740/).
- A larger, long-term follow-up study of 120 patients with new-onset guttate psoriasis (mean follow-up 6.2 years) found that 50.9% achieved complete remission, while 49.1% had persistent psoriatic disease. Of those with persistent disease, 17.5% had switched to the plaque psoriasis phenotype [(Galili et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10015744/).
- Factors associated with *better* prognosis (more likely to fully remit): younger age at onset, preceding streptococcal infection with high ASO titres, and absence of family history of plaque psoriasis.
- Factors associated with *worse* prognosis (more likely to persist): family history of chronic plaque psoriasis, multiple flares (>3), scalp involvement, palmoplantar involvement, and male sex.

In summary: approximately half to two-thirds of first-episode guttate psoriasis patients achieve spontaneous complete remission, documented in peer-reviewed follow-up studies. About one-third to one-half go on to develop chronic psoriasis.

## 22.3 Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: Spontaneous Remission Is Rare

For chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common form (80–90% of cases), spontaneous drug-free remission is uncommon. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of worsening (flares) and improvement, but complete spontaneous clearance without treatment is exceptional. When it does occur, it's typically temporary: most remission periods last 1–12 months. In clinical trial populations treated with biologics or tofacitinib, 42% of patients who achieve remission restart medication within one year, rising to 86% within five years [(Huang & Tsai, 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31270683/). A Danish nationwide cohort study found that among patients who achieved complete clearance (PASI 0) at biologic discontinuation, 50% remained in remission or managed with topical therapy alone for at least 2 years [(Nielsen et al., 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36739903/).

The biological explanation for this is the persistence of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells) discussed in Section 6.4. Even after visible plaques clear, the immunological "memory" of disease remains embedded in the skin, ready to reinitiate inflammation upon provocation.

## 22.4 On-Treatment Complete Clearance: Increasingly Achievable

### Dose Reduction and Interval Extension

Between full-dose treatment and complete discontinuation lies a middle ground that's gaining traction: dose reduction or interval extension. The idea is simple. If a patient achieves sustained clearance on a biologic, can you maintain that clearance while giving the drug less often?

Registry data and several prospective studies suggest you can. A systematic review of biologic dose reduction strategies found that 50-80% of patients who achieved stable clearance maintained acceptable disease control when dosing intervals were extended [(Atalay et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32474913/). The GUIDE trial (Section 27.3) is the most rigorous test of this approach, using structured guselkumab tapering in super-responders. IL-23 inhibitors appear particularly suited to interval extension because of their upstream mechanism: by blocking the master switch rather than the downstream effectors, they may achieve deeper immunological remission.

The practical appeal is obvious. Less frequent dosing means fewer injections, lower cost, reduced drug exposure, and potentially fewer side effects. The risk is disease relapse during the extended interval. Current evidence suggests that patients with shorter disease duration, complete clearance (not just near-clearance), and absence of psoriatic arthritis are the best candidates. If a flare occurs during dose reduction, returning to the standard dosing interval typically recaptures the response.

This isn't yet standard guideline practice, but it's happening in real-world clinical settings, and the evidence base is building.

Drug-free remission remains elusive for chronic plaque psoriasis, but *on-treatment* complete clearance (PASI 100) has become an increasingly realistic goal with modern biologics. The most effective IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. risankizumab) achieve PASI 100 in approximately 40–55% of patients, and newer agents like bimekizumab achieve even higher rates. PASI 90 (near-complete clearance) is achieved in 60–80% of patients on modern biologics. The 2025 NPF consensus statement reflects this shift: on-treatment remission is now defined as sustained complete clearance (BSA 0% or IGA 0) for at least 6 months. That's a standard far beyond the historical PASI 75 benchmark, recognising that complete clearance represents deeper suppression of the underlying systemic inflammation and may reduce the risk of psoriatic arthritis [(Armstrong et al., 2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40531503/).
