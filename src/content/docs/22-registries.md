Clinical trials demonstrate efficacy under idealised conditions. Real-world data from patient registries provide a complementary view of how treatments perform in everyday practice — including in patients who would have been excluded from trials.

## 22.1 Major Registries

Several national registries collect long-term prospective data on psoriasis patients receiving systemic and biologic therapies:

- **BADBIR** (British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register, UK/Ireland): The largest European psoriasis biologics registry, with over 20,000 registered patients. It tracks biologic safety, drug survival, and patient outcomes longitudinally.
- **PSOLAR** (Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry): A large US-based international registry (over 12,000 patients) that provided key long-term safety data for multiple biologics, including rates of serious infections, malignancy, and cardiovascular events.
- **PsoBest** (Germany): A national registry tracking over 10,000 patients on systemic therapies.
- **BioCAPTURE** (Netherlands): A registry focusing on biological therapies in psoriasis with long-term follow-up.

## 22.2 Key Findings from Real-World Data

Real-world evidence has confirmed and extended several findings from clinical trials. Drug survival — the length of time patients remain on a given therapy — provides a proxy for real-world effectiveness and tolerability. IL-23 inhibitors consistently demonstrate the highest drug survival rates, followed by IL-17 inhibitors and then TNF inhibitors. Real-world PASI 90 and 100 response rates tend to be somewhat lower than in clinical trials, reflecting the broader patient populations treated in practice. Registry data from BADBIR have also demonstrated no increased overall suicide risk in moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients compared to the general population, though patients with psychiatric comorbidities have significantly elevated suicidal ideation and self-harm rates — informing the recommendation for routine mental health screening.
